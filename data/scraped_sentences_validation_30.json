It is attested in Mycenaean Greek as e-re-pa  in Linear B syllabic script.

Interbreeding appears to have been common among elephantid species, which in some cases led to species with three ancestral genetic components, such as the Palaeoloxodon antiquus. In the Late Pleistocene, most proboscidean species vanished during the Quaternary glaciation which killed off 50% of genera weighing over 5 kg  worldwide..",
    "Proboscideans experienced several evolutionary trends, such as an increase in size, which led to many giant species that stood up to 500 cm  tall. As with other megaherbivores, including the extinct sauropod dinosaurs, the large size of elephants likely developed to allow them to survive on vegetation with low nutritional value. Their limbs grew longer and the feet shorter and broader. The feet were originally plantigrade and developed into a digitigrade stance with cushion pads and the sesamoid bone providing support. Early proboscideans developed longer mandibles and smaller craniums while more derived ones developed shorter mandibles, which shifted the head's centre of gravity.",
    "The cheek teeth  of proboscideans became larger and more specialized, especially after elephants started to switch from C3-plants to C4-grasses, which caused their teeth to undergo a three-fold increase in teeth height as well as substantial multiplication of lamellae after about five million years ago.",
    "Some proboscideans developed tusks from their lower incisors. Elephants retain certain features from their aquatic ancestry, such as their middle ear anatomy..",

    "\"Long, Long, Long\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1968 album The Beatles .",
    "\"Long, Long, Long\" originated during a period in which Harrison emerged as a prolific songwriter, coinciding with his return to the guitar after two years of studying the Indian sitar.",
    "\"Long, Long, Long\" has received praise from several music critics.",
    "George Harrison began writing \"Long, Long, Long\" during the Beatles' stay in Rishikesh, India, between February and April 1968. It was one of many songs that marked Harrison's return to the guitar as his principal musical instrument, after he had dedicated himself to mastering the Indian sitar in 1966. This coincided with a new, prolific period in his songwriting, which musicologist Walter Everett likens to the arrival of John Lennon and Paul McCartney as composers in 1963..",
    "Led by Harrison's commitment, the four band members went to Rishikesh to study Transcendental Meditation under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. They departed for England separately, however, between 1 March and 12 April, and their mixed experiences on the course contributed to the divisiveness that pervaded the group upon their return. Harrison continued to espouse the Maharishi's teachings; this position left him isolated within the band and represented an impediment to their unity that was unprecedented in the group's career. Author Simon Leng describes \"Long, Long, Long\" as the first song in which Harrison \"share the spiritual refuge he'd found\" through meditation, as well as \"a confluence of the Indian, folk, and spiritual influences\" that had preoccupied him since 1966..",
    "Donovan, the Scottish singer-songwriter who joined in the Beatles' musical activities in Rishikesh, recalled that Harrison played both sitar and guitar at the ashram and was developing a style of music that became \"the finest spiritual sound\". Harrison completed the lyrics to \"Long, Long, Long\" in August that year, at which point the Beatles were part-way through the recording of their eponymous double album, also known as \"the White Album\". In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, he states that \"the 'you' in 'Long Long Long' is God.\" He also says that his musical inspiration for the composition was Bob Dylan's \"Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\" – specifically, \"D to E minor, A and D – those three chords and the way they moved\". As a further influence in \"Long, Long, Long\", Leng cites the release of the Band's debut album, Music from Big Pink, which \"signaled the rebirth of 'the song'\" as an alternative to the excesses of 1967-era psychedelia..",
    "According to musicologist Alan Pollack, \"Long, Long, Long\" is \"an off-beat mixture\" of contemporary musical styles; he identifies it as \"a three-way cross between jazz waltz, folk song, and late sixties psychedelia\". The song is in the key of F major, played with a capo on the guitar's third fret, so as to allow for the chord shapes that Harrison admired in \"Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\". The melody appears to fluctuate from the home key, due to its avoidance of perfect cadences, as the dominant, C7 chord resists anchoring on the tonic I chord of F major.",
    "Lyrically, the song takes the form of a reconciliation with a loved one after a long period of estrangement. Theologian Dale Allison considers that, given the \"cryptic\" nature of the lyrics, it is only through Harrison's subsequent comments that the listener knows that he is addressing God rather than a woman. Allison likens the song's message to that of later Harrison compositions such as \"Try Some, Buy Some\" and \"Heading for the Light\", through its conveying of a \"conversion experience\"..",
    "The lyrics' reference to an extreme length of time is accentuated in the verses by the stretching out of a slow 6/8 metre into 9/8, and by the appending of a measure-long instrumental tag after each two bars of vocal melody. Partly as a result of the absence of resolution in the home key, the descending bassline in the verses – a 4–3–2–1 sequence of notes, mirroring the IV–iii–ii–I chord pattern – establishes an almost subliminal tonic..",
    "The mood of the song is gentle and meditative, with the more strident middle eight providing a brief departure from the calmness. In this section, Harrison sings of \"So many tears I was searching / So many tears I was wasting\", a statement that, according to author Ian Inglis, reflects the singer's \"rejoicing in his discovery of a deity to guide him through the vicissitudes of life\". Everett remarks on the close similarity between \"Long, Long, Long\" and \"Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\", as well as an understated musical mood akin to the Band's early work. The song's ending, which would come about through happenstance while the Beatles were working in the recording studio, is marked by Harrison playing a final, G minor 7 chord, which author Ian MacDonald considers \"one of the most resonant  in The Beatles' discography\"..",
    "The working title for the song was \"It's Been a Long, Long, Long Time\". Recording began at EMI Studios  in London on 7 October 1968, during the final week of sessions for the White Album. Since the start of the project, in late May, the album sessions had been fraught with disharmony, partly as a result of the constant presence of Yoko Ono, Lennon's new partner, and disagreements within the band over their new business venture, Apple Corps. While noting the context of the song's recording, MacDonald describes \"Long, Long, Long\" as Harrison's \"touching token of exhausted, relieved reconciliation with God\"..",
    "The recording session was a relaxed occasion; the burning of Indian incense helped to create the requisite atmosphere in the studio. The Beatles recorded 67 takes of the rhythm track, with Harrison on vocals and acoustic guitar, McCartney playing Hammond organ, and Ringo Starr on drums. The drum part includes a series of loud fills that serve as a commentary beside the vocal line, in the manner of Starr's playing on \"A Day in the Life\" in 1967. The idea for the end of the song was inspired by the sound created by a wine bottle sitting on a Leslie speaker, through which the organ was connected. Whenever McCartney played a certain note on the keyboard, the bottle began to vibrate, producing an eerie clattering sound that the Beatles decided to incorporate in their subsequent performances of the track. To compound the effect on the selected take, Starr played a fast snare drum roll and Harrison vocalised a prolonged, high-pitched wail. Chris Gerard of PopMatters comments on the \"palpable spiritual longing\" conveyed in the song and describes this coda as a \"weird spectral ending, with Harrison wailing like a wounded ghost while the band members rattle their instruments ominously\". In his book on the history of ambient music, Mark Prendergast cites the song as a ballad \"noteworthy for its Ambient production\"..",
    "Mixing on \"Long, Long, Long\" was completed on 14 October, with Starr's drum fills given prominence in the mix. Relative to the stereo version, the contrast between the song's quiet and louder moments is less pronounced in the mono mix, where Harrison's second vocal part also arrives earlier on the opening line..",
    "Apple Records released The Beatles on 22 November 1968, with \"Long, Long, Long\" appearing as the final track on side three of the double LP. The sequencing ensured that the song provided what author Mark Hertsgaard terms \"a calm landing pad\" after McCartney's heavy rock-styled \"Helter Skelter\". Shortly after the album's release, Harrison spent time with Dylan and the Band in Woodstock, in upstate New York. In addition to co-writing \"I'd Have You Anytime\" with Dylan, Harrison further established his independence from the Beatles during this visit, which music critic John Harris views as the foundation for All Things Must Pass..",
    "Among contemporary reviews of The Beatles, Alan Walsh of Melody Maker admired the song as \"a gentle, lilting track\" while, less impressed, Record Mirror considered it \"not a strong tune\", with drums \"monopolising the sound\". In his review for The Times, William Mann described \"Long, Long, Long\" as \"a melting love song in slow waltz tempo\" and rated it the equal of the nine best, \"superbly inventive\" compositions credited to Lennon–McCartney..",
    "Schaffner remarked on Harrison's limitations as a singer compared with Lennon and McCartney before adding: \"but when he tones his voice down to an ethereal near-whisper, as in 'Long Long Long,' he can evoke as well as anyone the magic and the mystery of what  Jonathan Cott has called 'the music of deep silence.'\" In Newsweek's mainly unfavourable review of The Beatles, Hubert Saal concluded by saying that Harrison was the album's \"hero\" and that \"Long, Long, Long\" and \"Savoy Truffle\" were its best songs.",
    "AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine views \"Long, Long, Long\" as \"haunting\" and, along with its composer's three other White Album tracks – \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", \"Piggies\" and \"Savoy Truffle\" – evidence that Harrison's songwriting \"deserved wider exposure\" than his typical quota of two songs on each Beatles LP. Less impressed with Harrison's other contributions to the album, Ian MacDonald welcomes \"Long, Long, Long\" with the words: \"at last – the real George.\" MacDonald considers it to be \"Harrison's finest moment on The Beatles: simple, direct, and, in its sighing, self-annihilating coda, devastatingly expressive\". Conversely, although he acknowledges its effectiveness in following \"Helter Skelter\", Tim Riley identifies \"Long, Long, Long\" as the weakest of the four Harrison songs, which are otherwise all \"essentials\" and \"regain the promise\" shown by his three compositions on the Beatles' Revolver album. Author Jonathan Gould praises the track as a \"dark beautiful ballad\" and a \"breakthrough\" for Harrison as a vocalist and composer, since it represents \"the first time he ever allowed himself to sound humbled by his emotions in a song\". Music critic Chris Ingham, writing for Rough Guides, similarly includes it among \"a new phase\" of Harrison compositions, along with \"Something\" and \"Here Comes the Sun\", in which \"warmth and sweetness\" replaced the dissonant qualities of his Indian-inspired melodies..",
    "Writing for Rolling Stone in 2002, Greg Kot deemed the song to be \"quintessential Harrison, summarizing the impending exhaustion of the Beatles and the era they defined, while pointing the way toward the spiritual heights achieved by his solo debut masterpiece, All Things Must Pass\". In his obituary of the former Beatle, for Rock's Backpages, Mat Snow included \"Long, Long, Long\" among his favourite Harrison compositions, saying: \"for my money the music of George Harrison is most compelling when dwelling in those strange shadows of elusive regret and longing, even fear ...\" David Quantick of Uncut admires it as \"a yearning, beautiful song\" and \"an oasis of calm and faith in the clattering chaos of the White Album\". He also considers the track to be \"arguably the least feted of the Beatles' great songs\"..",
    "\"Long, Long, Long\" was ranked 80th in Mojo's 2006 list \"The 101 Greatest Beatles Songs\".",
    " lament for a long-lost love which ends with a ghostly freakout\". In a similar list, in 2011, Rolling Stone ranked the song at number 98. Conversely, in 2012, readers of The Daily Telegraph voted \"Long, Long, Long\" as the fifth worst Beatles track. The following year, Mojo listed it at number 9 in a poll to determine \"the ultimate list of connoisseurs' Beatles' songs\", as defined by any track not included on the band's greatest-hits compilations 1962–1966 and 1967–1970..",
    "In 1987, Daniel Amos vocalist Terry Scott Taylor recorded what Trouser Press admired as a \"first-rate cover\" of \"Long, Long, Long\" for his album A Briefing for the Ascent. By contrast, Sean Carruthers of AllMusic considers singer Tom Hooper's 2002 cover to be a version that \"manages to drain the life\" out of the song. Elliott Smith included \"Long, Long, Long\" in his live performances. It was the last song he ever performed live. Smith biographer Benjamin Nugent writes that it appealed to Smith amid his struggles with depression and drug addiction, as \"a ballad about trying to get rid of self-imposed suffering and returning to a place where you can relate to other people\"..",
    "A recording by Tanya Donelly appeared on her 2006 album This Hungry Life and later on the CD accompanying Uncut's feature article on Harrison's career, in the August 2008 issue of the magazine. My Morning Jacket lead singer Jim James opened his 2009 EP of Harrison compositions, Tribute To, with \"Long, Long, Long\" – a cover that Drowned in Sound praised as \"not only the standout moment, but also one of the most beautiful and arresting songs of the year\". Having recorded the EP within days of Harrison's death in November 2001, James said he decided to release it eight years later partly as a result of attending the David Lynch Foundation's Transcendental Meditation awareness concert, \"Change Begins Within\", where \"George's name came up a lot ..",

    "Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago. Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity. Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE. By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest. Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda.",
    "Preserved by a resolutely vigilant oral tradition, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India. The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions. By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism, and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity. Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin. Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity, but also marked by the declining status of women, and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief. In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia..",
    "In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and western coasts. Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains, eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam. In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India. In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion. The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace, leaving a legacy of luminous architecture. Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty. British Crown rule began in 1858.",
    "The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly, but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and the public life took root.

    "By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved. The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago. After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan, Pakistan. These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation, the first urban culture in South Asia, which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in what is now Pakistan and western India. Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade..",
    "During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones. The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism, were composed during this period, and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain. Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west. The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period. On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation. In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period, as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions..",
    "Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira. Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India. In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal, and both established long-lasting monastic traditions.",
    "The Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and Southeast Asia. In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women. By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms. Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself. This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite. Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances..",
    "The Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity. When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan. When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal. When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south. No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region. During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes. The caste system consequently began to show regional differences..",
    "In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language. They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent. Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well. Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation. By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages..",
    "After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206. The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India.",
    "Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs. By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north. The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire. Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India, and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards..",
    "In the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers, fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors. The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule.",
    "Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive ruling elites, leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule. Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status. The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency, caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets. The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion, resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture. Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience. Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India. As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs..",
    "By the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts. The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies. Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue most of India by the 1820s. India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials.",
    "Many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period. By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the East India Company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform and culture..",
    "Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885."

    "Productive and unproductive labour are concepts that were used in classical political economy mainly in the 18th and 19th centuries, which survive today to some extent in modern management discussions, economic sociology and Marxist or Marxian economic analysis.",
    "In the introduction to The Wealth of Nations, Smith spoke of the \"annual labour\" and \"the necessaries and conveniences\" a nation \"annually consumes\" before explaining that one of the two steps to increase wealth is reducing the amount of \"unproductive labour\".",
    "\"Annual\" and \"annually\" refer to a cyclical reproduction process; \"unproductive labor\" are commodities and services which are not inputs to the next economic cycle and are therefore lost to economic growth.",
    "In contrast, theories with no such time horizon tend to understand Smith's unproductive labor as referring to services, and productive labor as meaning vendible goods. Smith’s distinction between productive and unproductive labor corresponds to Sraffa’s  distinction of basic and non-basic goods, as basic goods re-enter the productive process, whereas non-basic goods are destined for consumption, with no value for reproduction..",
    "As Edwin Cannan observes, Smith’s view of annual reproduction and as a consequence the distinction of productive and unproductive labor stems from his meeting, and the influence of, the French economists have known as the Physiocrats.",
    "In The Wealth of Nations, it is seen as the consumption of unproductive labor, limiting the growth of wealth.",
    "Smith's view that human labour – but not unproductive labour – is the source of wealth reflects the classical position that all commodities can be reduced to actual labour and produced inputs which in turn resolve into labour and former inputs.",
    "To maximize economic growth, therefore, \"unproductive costs\" which consumed part of the total national income rather than adding to it should be \"minimized; productive labor had to be maximized.",
    "Many different economic and moral arguments were made to either justify or else criticize the incomes gained from different activities, on the ground that they were \"productive\" or \"unproductive\", \"earned\" or \"unearned\", \"wealth-creating\" or \"wealth-consuming\".",

    "Obviously, unproductive activities could stimulate productive activities however .",
    "Many unproductive costs are accepted by business, either because they involve activities which lower total business costs, and thereby indirectly contribute to income, or because they are unavoidable in doing business.",
    "In the division of labour of modern advanced societies, unproductive functions in this Marxian sense occupy a very large part of the labour force; the wealthier a society is, the more \"unproductive\" functions it can afford.",

    "Many of his plays appeared in print as a series of quartos, but approximately half of them remained unpublished until 1623, when the posthumous First Folio was published.",
    "The traditional division of his plays into tragedies, comedies, and histories follows the categories used in the First Folio.",
    "However, modern criticism has labeled some of these plays \"problem plays\" that elude easy categorisation, or perhaps purposely break generic conventions, and has introduced the term romances for what scholars believe to be his later comedies.",
    "Previously, the most common forms of popular English theatre were the Tudor morality plays.",
    "These plays, generally celebrating piety, use personified moral attributes to urge or instruct the protagonist to choose the virtuous life over Evil.",
    "As a child, Shakespeare would likely have seen this type of play ..",
    "At the universities, plays were staged in a more academic form as Roman closet dramas.",
    "These plays, usually performed in Latin, adhered to classical ideas of unity and decorum, but they were also more static, valuing lengthy speeches over physical action.",
    "By the late 16th century, the popularity of morality and academic plays waned as the English Renaissance took hold, and playwrights like Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe revolutionized theatre.",
    "Their plays blended the old morality drama with classical theory to produce a new secular form. The new drama combined the rhetorical complexity of the academic play with the bawdy energy of the moralities.",
    "Inspired by this new style, Shakespeare continued these artistic strategies, creating plays that not only resonated on an emotional level with audiences but also explored and debated the basic elements of what it means to be human.",
    "Shakespeare's Elizabethan tragedies  demonstrate his relative independence from classical models.",
    "The influence of younger dramatists such as John Marston and Ben Jonson is seen not only in the problem plays, which dramatize intractable human problems of greed and lust, but also in the darker tone of the Jacobean tragedies. The Marlovian, heroic mode of the Elizabethan tragedies is gone, replaced by a darker vision of heroic natures caught in environments of pervasive corruption.",
    "Shakespeare's final plays hark back to his Elizabethan comedies in their use of romantic situation and incident. In these plays, however, the sombre elements that are largely glossed over in the earlier plays are brought to the fore and often rendered dramatically vivid.",
    "From the evidence of the title-page to The Two Noble Kinsmen and from textual analysis it is believed by some editors that Shakespeare ended his career in collaboration with Fletcher, who succeeded him as house playwright for the King's Men. These last plays resemble Fletcher's tragicomedies in their attempt to find a comedic mode capable of dramatising more serious events than had his earlier comedies.",
    "While many passages in Shakespeare's plays are written in prose, he almost always wrote a large proportion of his plays and poems in iambic pentameter.",
    "To end many scenes in his plays he used a rhyming couplet to give a sense of conclusion, or completion. A typical example is provided in Macbeth: as Macbeth leaves the stage to murder Duncan , he says,.",
    "Shakespeare's writing  also feature extensive wordplay in which double entendres and rhetorical flourishes are repeatedly used. Humour is a key element in all of Shakespeare's plays.",
    "Shakespeare's plays are also notable for their use of soliloquies, in which a character, apparently alone within the context of the play, makes a speech so that the audience may understand the character's inner motivations and conflict..",
    "Moreover, Hirsh asserts that in soliloquies in other Shakespearean plays, the speaker is entirely in character within the play's fiction.",
    "Saying that addressing the audience was outmoded by the time Shakespeare was alive, he \"acknowledges few occasions when a Shakespearean speech might involve the audience in recognising the simultaneous reality of the stage and the world the stage is representing.\" Other than 29 speeches delivered by choruses or characters who revert to that condition as epilogues \"Hirsh recognizes only three instances of audience address in Shakespeare's plays, 'all in very early comedies, in which audience address is introduced specifically to ridicule the practice as antiquated and amateurish.'\".",
    "As was common in the period, Shakespeare based many of his plays on the work of other playwrights and recycled older stories and historical material.",
    "His dependence on earlier sources was a natural consequence of the speed at which playwrights of his era wrote; in addition, plays based on already popular stories appear to have been seen as more likely to draw large crowds.",

They were displaced by Bantu peoples arriving from the north in the first millennium BC, most of whom likely originated in what is today northwestern Nigeria and southern Niger. Bantu speakers introduced the cultivation of bananas and taro, as well as large cattle herds, to Angola's central highlands and the Luanda plain.",
    "A number of political entities were established; the best-known of these was the Kingdom of the Kongo, based in Angola, which extended northward to what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of the Congo and Gabon.",
    "The Portuguese established their primary early trading post at Soyo, which is now the northernmost city in Angola apart from the Cabinda exclave.",
    "The Portuguese established several other settlements, forts and trading posts along the Angolan coast, principally trading in Angolan slaves for plantations.",
    "Despite Portugal's territorial claims in Angola, its control over much of the country's vast interior was minimal. In the 16th century Portugal gained control of the coast through a series of treaties and wars.",
    "John Iliffe notes that \"Portuguese records of Angola from the 16th century show that a great famine occurred on average every seventy years; accompanied by epidemic disease, it might kill one-third or one-half of the population, destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys\"..",
    "Colonial outposts also expanded inward from Benguela, but until the late 19th century the inroads from Luanda and Benguela were very limited. Hamstrung by a series of political upheavals in the early 1800s, Portugal was slow to mount a large scale annexation of Angolan territory..",
    "The slave trade was abolished in Angola in 1836, and in 1854 the colonial government freed all its existing slaves. Four years later, a more progressive administration appointed by Portugal abolished slavery altogether.",
    "By the mid-nineteenth century Portugal had established its dominion as far north as the Congo River and as far south as Mossâmedes. Until the late 1880s, Portugal entertained proposals to link Angola with its colony in Mozambique but was blocked by British and Belgian opposition. In this period, the Portuguese came up against different forms of armed resistance from various peoples in Angola..",
    "The Berlin Conference in 1884–1885 set the colony's borders, delineating the boundaries of Portuguese claims in Angola, although many details were unresolved until the 1920s. Trade between Portugal and its African territories rapidly increased as a result of protective tariffs, leading to increased development, and a wave of new Portuguese immigrants..",
    "Under colonial law, black Angolans were forbidden from forming political parties or labour unions. The first nationalist movements did not take root until after World War II, spearheaded by a largely Westernised and Portuguese-speaking urban class, which included many mestiços. During the early 1960s they were joined by other associations stemming from ad hoc labour activism in the rural workforce. Portugal's refusal to address increasing Angolan demands for self-determination provoked an armed conflict, which erupted in 1961 with the Baixa de Cassanje revolt and gradually evolved into a protracted war of independence that persisted for the next twelve years. Throughout the conflict, three militant nationalist movements with their own partisan guerrilla wings emerged from the fighting between the Portuguese government and local forces, supported to varying degrees by the Portuguese Communist Party..",
    "The National Front for the Liberation of Angola  recruited from Bakongo refugees in Zaire. Benefiting from particularly favourable political circumstances in Léopoldville, and especially from a common border with Zaire, Angolan political exiles were able to build up a power base among a large expatriate community from related families, clans, and traditions. People on both sides of the border spoke mutually intelligible dialects and enjoyed shared ties to the historical Kingdom of Kongo. Though as foreigners skilled Angolans could not take advantage of Mobutu Sese Seko's state employment programme, some found work as middlemen for the absentee owners of various lucrative private ventures.",
    "The migrants eventually formed the FNLA with the intention of making a bid for political power upon their envisaged return to Angola..",
    "A largely Ovimbundu guerrilla initiative against the Portuguese in central Angola from 1966 was spearheaded by Jonas Savimbi and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola . It remained handicapped by its geographic remoteness from friendly borders, the ethnic fragmentation of the Ovimbundu, and the isolation of peasants on European plantations where they had little opportunity to mobilise..",
    "During the late 1950s, the rise of the Marxist–Leninist Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola  in the east and Dembos hills north of Luanda came to hold special significance.",
    "Formed as a coalition resistance movement by the Angolan Communist Party, the organisation's leadership remained predominantly Ambundu and courted public sector workers in Luanda. Although both the MPLA and its rivals accepted material assistance from the Soviet Union or the People's Republic of China, the former harboured strong anti-imperialist views and was openly critical of the United States and its support for Portugal. This allowed it to win important ground on the diplomatic front, soliciting support from nonaligned governments in Morocco, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, and the United Arab Republic.."

Based on the conclusions drawn by several studies and findings such as Pella curse tablet, Emilio Crespo and other scholars suggest that ancient Macedonian was a Northwest Doric dialect, which shares isoglosses with its neighboring Thessalian dialects spoken in northeastern Thessaly..",

Having a negative body image or a history of depression can also be a significant risk factor. These are further exacerbated by parental pressures surrounding appearance, media influence, and peer pressure.

    "The scientific names of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa × paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata × M.",
    "Musa species are native to tropical Indomalaya and Australia, and are likely to have been first domesticated in Papua New Guinea. They are grown in 135 countries, primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser extent to make fiber, banana wine, and banana beer, and as ornamental plants.",
    "The world's largest producers of bananas in 2017 were India and China, which together accounted for approximately 38% of total production..",
    "Worldwide, there is no sharp distinction between \"bananas\" and \"plantains\".",
    "Especially in the Americas and Europe, \"banana\" usually refers to soft, sweet, dessert bananas, particularly those of the Cavendish group, which are the main exports from banana-growing countries.",
    "In the US, as of 2019, these bananas, by poundage, are the most consumed fresh fruit. By contrast, Musa cultivars with firmer, starchier fruit are called \"plantains\".",
    "In other regions, such as Southeast Asia, many more kinds of banana are grown and eaten, so the binary distinction is not as useful and is not made in local languages.",
    "The term \"banana\" is also used as the common name for the plants that produce the fruit. This can extend to other members of the genus Musa, such as the scarlet banana , the pink banana , and the Fe'i bananas.",
    "It can also refer to members of the genus Ensete, such as the snow banana  and the economically important false banana .",
    "Both genera are in the banana family, Musaceae.",
    "The banana plant is the largest herbaceous flowering plant. All the above-ground parts of a banana plant grow from a structure usually called a \"corm\". Plants are normally tall and fairly sturdy with a treelike appearance, but what appears to be a trunk is actually a \"false stem\" or pseudostem.",
    "Bananas grow in a wide variety of soils, as long as the soil is at least 60 centimetres  deep, has good drainage and is not compacted. Banana plants are among the fastest growing of all plants, with daily surface growth rates recorded of 1.4 square metres  to 1.6 square metres ..",
    "The leaves of banana plants are composed of a stalk  and a blade .",
    "As new growth occurs in the centre of the pseudostem the edges are forced apart. Cultivated banana plants vary in height depending on the variety and growing conditions.",
    "Most are around 5 m  tall, with a range from 'Dwarf Cavendish' plants at around 3 m  to 'Gros Michel' at 7 m  or more. Leaves are spirally arranged and may grow 2.7 metres  long and 60 cm  wide. They are easily torn by the wind, resulting in the familiar frond look. When a banana plant is mature, the corm stops producing new leaves and begins to form a flower spike or inflorescence.",
    "A stem develops which grows up inside the pseudostem, carrying the immature inflorescence until eventually it emerges at the top. Each pseudostem normally produces a single inflorescence, also known as the \"banana heart\".",
    "The banana fruits develop from the banana heart, in a large hanging cluster, made up of tiers , with up to 20 fruit to a tier.",
    "The hanging cluster is known as a bunch, comprising 3–20 tiers, or commercially as a \"banana stem\", and can weigh 30–50 kilograms .",
    "Individual banana fruits  average 125 grams , of which approximately 75% is water and 25% dry matter .",

    "As with all living things on earth, potassium-containing bananas emit radioactivity at low levels occurring naturally from potassium-40 , which is one of several isotopes of potassium. The banana equivalent dose of radiation was developed in 1995 as a simple teaching-tool to educate the public about the natural, small amount of K-40 radiation occurring in every human and in common foods..",
    "The K-40 in a banana emits about 15 becquerels or 0.1 microsieverts , an amount that does not add to the total body radiation dose when a banana is consumed. By comparison, the normal radiation exposure of an average person over one day is 10 microsieverts, a commercial flight across the United States exposes a person to 40 microsieverts, and the total yearly radiation exposure from the K-40 sources in a person's body is about 390 microsieverts..",
    "The word \"banana\" is thought to be of West African origin, possibly from the Wolof word banaana, and passed into English via Spanish or Portuguese..",
    "The genus Musa was created by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. The name may be derived from Antonius Musa, physician to the Emperor Augustus, or Linnaeus may have adapted the Arabic word for banana, mauz. According to Roger Blench, the ultimate origin of musa is in the Trans–New Guinea languages, whence they were borrowed into the Austronesian languages and across Asia, via the Dravidian languages of India, into Arabic as a Wanderwort..",
    "The classification of cultivated bananas has long been a problematic issue for taxonomists.",
    "Linnaeus originally placed bananas into two species based only on their uses as food: Musa sapientum for dessert bananas and Musa paradisiaca for plantains.",
    "In a series of papers published from 1947 onwards, Ernest Cheesman showed that Linnaeus's Musa sapientum and Musa paradisiaca were cultivars and descendants of two wild seed-producing species, Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana, both first described by Luigi Aloysius Colla. Cheesman recommended the abolition of Linnaeus's species in favor of reclassifying bananas according to three morphologically distinct groups of cultivars – those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of Musa balbisiana, those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of Musa acuminata, and those with characteristics of both. Researchers Norman Simmonds and Ken Shepherd proposed a genome-based nomenclature system in 1955.",

    "It is administered on behalf of the College Board by the Educational Testing Service, which until recently developed the SAT as well. The test is intended to assess students' readiness for college.",
    "The SAT was originally designed not to be aligned with high school curricula, but several adjustments were made for the version of the SAT introduced in 2016, and College Board president David Coleman has said that he also wanted to make the test reflect more closely what students learn in high school with the new Common Core standards..",
    "Starting with the 2015–16 school year, the College Board began working with Khan Academy to provide free SAT preparation. On January 19, 2021, the College Board announced the discontinuation of the optional essay section, as well as its SAT Subject Tests, after June 2021..",
    "While a considerable amount of research has been done on the SAT, many questions and misconceptions remain. Outside of college admissions, the SAT is also used by researchers studying human intelligence in general and intellectual precociousness in particular, and by some employers in the recruitment process..",

The smallest edge weight on this path is known as the capacity or bandwidth of the path.",

    "In the US, about half of all adults read one or more books for pleasure each year. About 5% read more than 50 books per year. Americans read more if they: have more education, read fluently and easily, are female, live in cities, and have higher socioeconomic status. Children become better readers when they know more about the world in general, and when they perceive reading as fun rather than another chore to be performed..",

Guitarist Christopher Thorn, originally from Pennsylvania, was added shortly thereafter; the four eventually convinced drummer Glen Graham to relocate from Mississippi to complete the group after failing to find a drummer in Los Angeles.

Kim Possible also explores the highs and lows of Kim's life as a high school student attempting to navigate dating, captaining her high school's cheerleading squad, academics, sports, homework, exams and eventually learning to drive, all the while striving to maintain a healthy work–life balance; fighting crime typically comes to Kim more naturally than the more standard components of adolescence..",

    "Long-time collaborators and veteran Disney writers, Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle had already been writing for Disney Channel for several years, contributing to the network's male-led animated series Aladdin, Hercules and Buzz Lightyear of Star Command, each one spin-offs of their respective feature-length animated films. Although they had enjoyed working on those projects, Schooley and McCorkle were becoming interested in contributing to \"something original\". At the same time, the writers learned that Disney Channel had become interested in developing a show featuring ordinary children in extraordinary circumstances. Thus, the network commissioned Schooley and McCorkle to create an animated series geared towards the 9- to 14-year-old demographic that was also capable of entertaining older audiences at the same time. While traveling in an elevator on their way back to their office from their lunch break, McCorkle said to Schooley, \"Kim Possible.",
    "She can do anything\", to which Schooley responded, \"Ron Stoppable, he can't\", and nearly the entire premise of Kim Possible naturally unfolded thereafter. According to Schooley and McCorkle, both lead characters' names indicate that Kim Possible \"is going to be an arched show that is a little bit over the top, but also that the girl is going to be the action lead and the guy is going to be funny.\" Conceiving all main characters themselves, Rufus and Wade were eventually created and added to the roster, but the series essentially remains about Kim \"who is incredibly competent in the action world but challenged in the real world\" while \"Ron would be challenged everywhere.\".",
    "With its main duo finally established, Kim Possible became the easiest show Schooley and McCorkle had ever developed. One of Disney Channel's earliest forays into developing an entirely original animated series \"from scratch\", Kim Possible was born out of the creators' realization that there were few animated series starring strong female characters at the time and created Kim as \"a character that ..",

Romano had already been well known to Disney Channel audiences for her portrayal of Ren Stevens on the series Even Stevens, and began voicing Kim while completing her stint on the show. Her first voice acting role, Romano immediately identified with her character because both were \"dealing with teenage issues\" at the same time, comparing Kim's challenge of battling both her personal life and villains to herself balancing schoolwork with her budding acting career; the actress was forced to forfeit her own senior prom due to Kim Possible commitments.

    "Serving as executive producers in addition to writers throughout the entire series, Schooley and McCorkle oversaw the show for its entire duration to maintain consistency. As executive producers, Schooley and McCorkle were mostly involved in the writing process, focusing mainly on plot and dialogue, while storyboarding was chiefly handled by Loter. The writing staff consisted of both Disney Channel employees and freelance writers. Much of the series is based on both Schooley and McCorkle's own experiences growing up as teenagers in high school. Although essentially a comedy series, Schooley and McCorkle also combined elements of adventure, relationships, and humor in order to appeal to both boys, who are primarily interested in action, and girls, who are more-so attracted to relationships and character development, aware of \"ancient truisms\" surrounding the belief that boys are generally less likely to watch a series starring a female lead, while girls seldom exhibit such reservations when the casting situation is reversed. Without alienating younger viewers, to whom the show refuses to \"talk down\", the writing in Kim Possible is \"a little older than\" that of traditional Disney animated series. While avoiding adult references, Schooley and McCorkle opted for a fast-paced sitcom-style dialogue and rhythm that attracted adult viewers instead, ultimately resulting in teleplays that were typically five pages longer than traditional Disney Channel scripts. Additionally, the show heavily parodies the popular James Bond films. Kim Possible's showrunners were heavily influenced by Marvel Comics, particularly the Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, and X-Men comic book series. One particularly strong influence is found in Dr.",
    "Drakken and James Possible's former friendship, whose relationship closely mirrors that of the Fantastic Four's Victor von Doom/Doctor Doom and Reed Richards/Mr.",
    "Some of the show's plots and ideas are drawn from the lives of both creators' daughters; the decision to have Ron eventually join his school's football team was inspired by Schooley's daughter being involved in her high school band, which resulted in them attending several school football matches. Citing Ron as his favorite character, McCorkle admitted that he reminds him of his high school self. Although not as strong an action hero as Kim, at the same time the creators were careful to highlight Ron's courage and attributes by emphasizing the fact that he constantly finds himself in dangerous situations. By the fourth and final season, the writers had taken into consideration male fans' requests to see Ron succeed more often than he had in earlier seasons, developing him into a more confident character as he gradually \"come into his own\" and becomes more of a partner than a sidekick. Drakken and Shego's relationship \"weirdly\" mirrors Kim and Ron's to some extent, with the female character remaining smarter and more competent than her fumbling male teammate. Initially envisioned as a \"standard sidekick\", Sullivan's sarcastic interpretation of Shego ultimately inspired Schooley and McCorkle to expand upon the humor revolving around the fact that Shego is barely able to tolerate Drakken. The creators had always intended for Kim and Ron to eventually become romantically involved but avoided this storyline in fear of \"paint ourselves in a corner\", citing Sam and Diane's ill-fated relationship in the sitcom Cheers as an example. Throughout the first three seasons, the idea of Ron having feelings for Kim is alluded to, but he never pursues them for various reasons. Production on new episodes of Kim Possible had virtually ceased by the end of Season 3 when Kim and Ron finally become a couple, which McCorkle felt had ended the series perfectly in the film Kim Possible: So the Drama, thus initially eliminating any need to determine how they were to proceed with them as a new couple. However, when the series was surprisingly renewed for a fourth season, Schooley and McCorkle were forced to confronted the challenge of writing for Kim and Ron as a couple for the first time but eventually grew to appreciate their \"new dynamic\", which provided the show with \"new life\" while allowing the writers to explore previously uncharted comedic territory. In fact, fans' interest in the new power couple's relationship was one of the main reasons the show was renewed. Schooley and McCorkle returned from other projects they had begun working on to complete the series..",
    "We still have the villains, and we have the comedy with the villains and their bizarre schemes and how they get foiled.\" The fourth season introduces new villains such as Camille Léon, a shapeshifting celebrity heiress, and Warmonga, a more serious villain who possesses \"No funny clownish behavior, just evil.\" The villains also work together against Kim in different combinations. Kim is also given her own car while her brothers, having skipped several grades due to their intelligence, join her in high school despite being only 12 years-old, much to Kim's chagrin. Wade ventures outside his bedroom more often, occasionally assisting Kim and Ron in person. The recurring character Monique, who was created because Schooley and McCorkle felt that Kim would be more realistic if she were to have a female best friend in addition to Ron, is expanded from that of simply an observer of Kim and Ron's lives to a more involved member of Team Possible, broadening the ensemble. Ron's home life is also explored as he welcomes a younger sibling. The series ends with Kim and Ron graduating. Several Season 4 episodes were edited and shortened for time because they would run up to five minutes too long, forcing Loter to eliminate some sub plots and characters. Steve Loter documented the production of the final episode of season four, and thus the completion of the Kim Possible franchise, in a blog titled \"So the Finale\" hosted on Blogger.",
    "Creating the Kim Possible universe and environment was very much a collaborative process between Schooley and McCorkle, Disney Channel, the character designers, and the cast, who were also encouraged to contribute their own ideas. Although Schooley and McCorkle participated in designing Kim, the majority of that particular task was the combined efforts of Loter, inaugural season director Chris Bailey, art director Alan Bodner and character designer Stephen Silver, each of whom had worked together on previous animated projects. Due to their extensive animation experience, Schooley and McCorkle were aware that \"Kim had to be an appealing character\", while Ron would be more-so \"goofy-appealing\". Evolving dramatically over the course of three months, Kim, who had originally been designed to resemble a \"standard\" athletic-looking blonde heroine, underwent several changes. At one point, the character's appearance was based on that of video game character Lara Croft from the Tomb Raider franchise until Disney Channel abandoned this concept in favor of one more akin to that of a 14 year-old girl as opposed to a bombshell. Admitting that Kim would have been their dream girl in high school, the creators joked, \"She would have been way out of our class though.\" A super suit designed for the character was introduced in early Season 4 but quickly abandoned once the writers realized that the costume would detract from the character's established \"she can do anything\" reputation. However, her original mission outfit consisting of a crop top and cargo pants is permanently replaced by a T-shirt and pants. Meanwhile, the outfits of Team Impossible were influenced by the X-Men's \"classic\" blue and gold uniforms..",
    "Loter typically visualized whatever script he was provided with after they had been written. With characters drawn with large heads and eyes, the show's colorful, \"hip and retro\" style is reminiscent of \"campy\" spy films released during the 1960s and 1970s. The New York Times observed that the show's retro setting is more similar to that of The Jetsons than The Simpsons. Using a limited animation style, the characters wear a wide variety of costumes and hairstyles. Opting for a \"simplicity that was the hallmark of\" the 1960s, some of the architecture in Kim Possible is reminiscent of lairs owned by James Bond villains, while Bodner was inspired by the graphic design of posters Disney used during the same decade, as well a Chuck Jones and Maurice Noble. In Season 4, some episodes were intentionally filmed in multiplane to achieve a more cinematic image. Additionally, Disney Channel's animated series American Dragon: Jake Long inspired the animators and artists to approach Kim Possible's final season with an \"edgier\" design. Director Steve Loter declared that Season 4 was the \"most international season\" because Kim and Ron travel to more exotic countries..",
    "Written by musicians Cory Lerios and George Gabriel, the show's theme song \"Call Me, Beep Me\"  is performed by American recording artist Christina Milian. Having already been working for Disney Channel at the time, appearing as a correspondent on the network's miniseries Movie Surfers after declining an offer to appear on their variety show The Mickey Mouse Club, Milian learned about Kim Possible from Disney when the studio called her in recruitment of an artist to record the new show's theme song. After meeting with the songwriters, who then proceeded to write the song, for the first time, Milian returned to the studio to record \"Call Me, Beep Me\" one week later. Romano also contributed vocals to the song. Described as a Motown-influenced R&B and teen pop track, \"Call Me, Beep Me\" is heard during the show's opening title sequence, encouraging viewers and listeners to contact Kim for assistance should they ever find themselves in difficult situations, featuring the lyrics \"Danger or trouble, I'm there on the double.\" The sounds of mobile devices and modern-day technology are incorporated throughout the song. Although \"Call Me, Beep Me\" begins \"I'm your basic, average girl\" in reference to Kim, these lyrics are paradoxical because there is little basic or average about its protagonist. A music video was released for \"Call Me, Beep Me\", which features Milian and Romano recording the song in the recording studio interspersed with short scenes from the series..",
    "Didn't know so many people were watching Kim Possible like that.",
    "Because of that song, it actually inspired me to do my own musical animated artist because a lot of people thought I was Kim Possible.\" Milian has yet to perform the song live in concert but has expressed interest in recording a remix for fans. \"Call Me, Beep Me\" was the first song Lerios and Gabriel wrote together, and the songwriting duo has since gone on to collaborate on both scoring and writing songs for several other major television networks and programs. \"Call Me, Beep Me\" became so popular among fans of both the show that several of them proceeded to download it as their own cell phone ringtones, including Milian herself..",
    "While the music in Kim Possible is mostly guitar-driven, Berry's scoring experience prior to the show had been exclusively orchestral, composing scores using only a keyboard. A guitarist since the age of six, Berry himself provided all the guitar and bass musical cues in Kim Possible. Although discussing whether or not popular music featured in the series should be stylistically similar to the score, Disney decided to avoid limiting the show to then-current musical trends because, according to Berry, \"trying to be current is one of the best ways to sound dated.\" While themes of electronic music are heard during the scene's fight sequences, guitar riffs of \"Call Me, Beep Me\" are reprised throughout episodes. Smash Mouth lead singer Steve Harwell made a guest appearance in the Season 2 episode \"Queen BeBe\" in December 2003. The third season introduced several character-specific songs. The title sequence was almost entirely updated with the premiere of the fourth season, though \"Call Me, Beep Me\" remained unchanged..",
    "An official Kim Possible soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on July 1, 2003, featuring \"Call Me, Beep Me\" and \"Could it Be\", in addition to other musical contributions from the cast of Kim Possible in addition to various Disney recording artists, including Aaron Carter. Romano also recorded a new song entitled \"Say the Word\" for the album. A combination of teen pop, pop rock, power pop and R&B music, the soundtrack also features appearances by musical groups A-Teens, Jump5 , LMNT and Smash Mouth, and Will Friedle and Nancy Cartwright's \"Naked Mole Rap\", a rapped tribute to Ron's pet Rufus, ultimately concluding with a \"work-you-up remix\" of the theme song by Tony Phillip. Aimed primarily at the show's young fan base, AllMusic writer Heather Phares reviewed the album as \"a better than average children's soundtrack.\".",
    "Episodes typically adhere to a simple, similar format, featuring a power-hungry villain who Kim and Ron must somehow prevent from taking over the world. Although primarily an action comedy TV series, Music in Television: Channels of Listening author James Deaville observed that Kim Possible adheres to the long-standing tradition of combining adventure with comedy in animated television. According to Telebisyon, \"The show is fairly action-oriented, but also has a strong, light-hearted comedic atmosphere\". In addition to action, comedy and adventure, Kim Possible's storylines also explore elements of romance and drama. According to The Artifice, the show's unique brand of humor distinguishes it from the slapstick style associated with most Disney Channel sitcoms, namely Phil of the Future and That's so Raven, although Ron can be considered a slapstick character. The villains are also depicted as clever, yet comical. With a tendency not to take itself seriously, Kim Possible both parodies and pays homage to the spy, action and superhero genres, its comedy benefiting from the show's emphasis on \"over-the-top plots\" and circumstances. Shego's own family of superheroes, Team Go, is a deliberate parody of the Marvel superhero team the Fantastic Four; the series also references the Tomb Raider and Mission: Impossible film franchises. Self-referential in its humor that avoids talking down to viewers, the series additionally parodies the teen sitcom genre, teenage fads and trends in general, and sometimes makes fun of its own plot holes and oversights, while occasionally adopting common cartoon and sitcom tropes.."

However, Yeon Gaesomun died of a natural cause in 666 and Goguryeo was thrown into chaos and weakened by a succession struggle among his sons and younger brother, with his eldest son defecting to Tang and his younger brother defecting to Silla.

    "Baekje was once a great military power on the Korean Peninsula, most notably in the 4th century during the rule of Geunchogo when its influence extended across the sea to Liaoxi and Shandong in China, taking advantage of the weakened state of Former Qin, and Kyushu in the Japanese archipelago; however, Baekje was critically defeated by Gwanggaeto the Great and declined..",

    "The Younger Dryas, which occurred circa 12,900 to 11,700 years BP, was a return to glacial conditions which temporarily reversed the gradual climatic warming after the Last Glacial Maximum , which lasted from circa 27,000 to 20,000 years BP.",
    "The Younger Dryas was the last stage of the Pleistocene epoch that spanned from 2,580,000 to 11,700 years BP and it preceded the current, warmer Holocene epoch.",
    "The Younger Dryas was the most severe and long lasting of several interruptions to the warming of the Earth's climate, and it was preceded by the Late Glacial Interstadial, an interval of relative warmth that lasted from 14,670 to 12,900 BP.",
    "The Younger Dryas did not affect the climate worldwide.",
    "The Younger Dryas is named after an indicator genus, the alpine-tundra wildflower Dryas octopetala, as its leaves are occasionally abundant in late glacial, often minerogenic-rich sediments, such as the lake sediments of Scandinavia.",
    "Paleobotanical and lithostratigraphic studies of Swedish and Danish bog and lake sites, as in the Allerød clay pit in Denmark, first recognized and described the Younger Dryas..",
    "The Younger Dryas is the youngest and longest of three stadials, which resulted from typically abrupt climatic changes that took place over the last 16,000 years. Within the Blytt–Sernander classification of north European climatic phases, the prefix \"Younger\" refers to the recognition that this original \"Dryas\" period was preceded by a warmer stage, the Allerød oscillation, which, in turn, was preceded by the Older Dryas, around 14,000 calibrated years BP.",
    "In northern Scotland, the glaciers were thicker and more extensive than during the Younger Dryas. The Older Dryas, in turn, was preceded by another warmer stage, the Bølling oscillation, that separated it from a third and even older stadial, often known as the Oldest Dryas.",

    "In Ireland, the Younger Dryas has also been known as the Nahanagan Stadial, and in Great Britain it has been called the Loch Lomond Stadial. In the Greenland Summit ice core chronology, the Younger Dryas corresponds to Greenland Stadial 1 .",
    "Since 1916 and the onset and the subsequent refinement of pollen analytical techniques and a steadily-growing number of pollen diagrams, palynologists have concluded that the Younger Dryas was a distinct period of vegetational change in large parts of Europe during which vegetation of a warmer climate was replaced by that of a generally cold climate, a glacial plant succession that often contained Dryas octopetala.",
    "The change to glacial conditions at the onset of the Younger Dryas in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, between 12,900 and 11,500 calibrated years BP, has been argued to have been quite abrupt. It is in sharp contrast to the warming of the preceding Older Dryas interstadial.",
    "Its end has been inferred to have occurred over a period of a decade or so, but the onset may have even been faster. Thermally fractionated nitrogen and argon isotope data from Greenland ice core GISP2 indicate that its summit was around 15 °C  colder during the Younger Dryas than today.",
    "In addition to the Younger, Older, and Oldest Dryases, a century-long period of colder climate, similar to the Younger Dryas in abruptness, has occurred within both the Bølling oscillation and the Allerød oscillation interstadials.",
    "Examples of older Younger Dryas-like events have been reported from the ends  of older glacial periods.",
    "Temperature-sensitive lipids, long chain alkenones, found in lake and marine sediments, are well-regarded as a powerful paleothermometer for the quantitative reconstruction of past continental climates. The application of alkenone paleothermometers to high-resolution paleotemperature reconstructions of older glacial terminations have found that very similar, Younger Dryas-like paleoclimatic oscillations occurred during Terminations II and IV. If so, the Younger Dryas is not the unique paleoclimatic event, in terms of size, extent, and rapidity, as it is often regarded to be. Furthermore, paleoclimatologists and Quaternary geologists reported finding what they characterized as well-expressed Younger Dryas events in the Chinese δ18\nO records of Termination III in stalagmites from high-altitude caves in Shennongjia area, Hubei Province, China. Various paleoclimatic records from ice cores, deep-sea sediments, speleothems, continental paleobotanical data, and loesses show similar abrupt climate events, which are consistent with Younger Dryas events, during the terminations of the last four glacial periods .",
    "They argue that Younger Dryas events might be an intrinsic feature of deglaciations that occur at the end of glacial periods..",
    "Analyses of stable isotopes from Greenland ice cores provide estimates for the start and end of the Younger Dryas.",
    "The analysis of Greenland Summit ice cores, as part of the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 and Greenland Icecore Project, estimated that the Younger Dryas started about 12,800 ice  years BP.",
    "Depending on the specific ice core analysis consulted, the Younger Dryas is estimated to have lasted 1,150~1,300 years. Measurements of oxygen isotopes from the GISP2 ice core suggest the ending of the Younger Dryas took place over just 40~50 years in three discrete steps, each lasting five years.",
    "The end of the Younger Dryas has been dated to around 11,550 years ago, occurring at 10,000 BP , a \"radiocarbon plateau\" by a variety of methods, mostly with consistent results:.",
    "The International Commission on Stratigraphy put the start of the Greenlandian stage, and implicitly the end of the Younger Dryas, at 11,700 years before 2000..",
    "Although the start of the Younger Dryas is regarded to be synchronous across the North Atlantic region, recent research concluded that the start of the Younger Dryas might be time-transgressive even within there.",
    "After an examination of laminated varve sequences, Muschitiello and Wohlfarth found that the environmental changes that define the beginning of the Younger Dryas are diachronous in their time of occurrence according to latitude.",

  "Yen": [
    "The yen  is the official currency of Japan.",
    "The New Currency Act of 1871 introduced Japan's modern currency system, with the yen defined as 1.5 g  of gold, or 24.26 g  of silver, and divided decimally into 100 sen or 1,000 rin.",
    "The yen replaced the previous Tokugawa coinage as well as the various hansatsu paper currencies issued by feudal han .",
    "Following World War II, the yen lost much of its prewar value.",
    "To stabilize the Japanese economy, the exchange rate of the yen was fixed at ¥360 per US$ as part of the Bretton Woods system.",
    "When that system was abandoned in 1971, the yen became undervalued and was allowed to float.",
    "The yen had appreciated to a peak of ¥271 per US$ in 1973, then underwent periods of depreciation and appreciation due to the 1973 oil crisis, arriving at a value of ¥227 per US$ by 1980.",
    "Since 1973, the Japanese government has maintained a policy of currency intervention, so the yen is under a \"dirty float\" regime.",
    "The Japanese government focused on a competitive export market, and tried to ensure a low exchange rate for the yen through a trade surplus.",
    "The Plaza Accord of 1985 temporarily changed this situation; the exchange rate fell from its average of ¥239 per dollar in 1985 to ¥128 in 1988 and led to a peak rate of ¥80 against the US$ in 1995, effectively increasing the value of Japan’s GDP in dollar terms to almost that of the United States. Since that time, however, the world price of the yen has greatly decreased.",
    "Yen derives from the Japanese word 圓 , which borrows its phonetic reading from Chinese yuan, similar to North Korean won and South Korean won.",
    "The spelling and pronunciation \"yen\" is standard in English because when Japan was first encountered by Europeans around the 16th century, Japanese /e/  and /we/  both had been pronounced  and Portuguese missionaries had spelled them \"ye\". By the middle of the 18th century, /e/ and /we/ came to be pronounced  as in modern Japanese, although some regions retain the  pronunciation.",
    "Walter Henry Medhurst, who had neither been to Japan nor met any Japanese people, having consulted mainly a Japanese-Dutch dictionary, spelled some \"e\"s as \"ye\" in his An English and Japanese, and Japanese and English Vocabulary . In the early Meiji era, James Curtis Hepburn, following Medhurst, spelled all \"e\"s as \"ye\" in his A Japanese and English dictionary ; in Japanese, e and i are slightly palatalized, somewhat as in Russian. That was the first full-scale Japanese-English/English-Japanese dictionary, which had a strong influence on Westerners in Japan and probably prompted the spelling \"yen\".",
    "Hepburn revised most \"ye\"s to \"e\" in the 3rd edition  to mirror the contemporary pronunciation, except \"yen\". Since 1946, the spelling \"yen\" is depicted on Japanese banknotes..",
    "Ōkuma proposed that coins, which were previously square, be made into circles, and that the names of the traditional currencies, ryō , bu  and shu , be unified into yen , which was accepted by the government..",
    "On June 27, 1871, the Meiji government officially adopted the \"yen\" as Japan's modern unit of currency under the New Currency Act of 1871. While initially defined at par with the Spanish and Mexican dollars then circulating in the 19th century at 0.78 troy ounce  of fine silver, the yen was also defined as 1.5 grams of fine gold, considering recommendations to put the currency on the bimetallic standard.",
    "The Act also stipulated the adoption of the decimal accounting system of yen , sen , and rin , with the coins being round and manufactured using Western machinery acquired from Hong Kong.",
    "The yen replaced the complex monetary system of the Edo period in the form of Tokugawa coinage as well as the various hansatsu paper currencies issued by Japan's feudal fiefs in an array of incompatible denominations.",
    "Following the silver devaluation of 1873, the yen devalued against the US and Canadian dollars , and by 1897, the yen was worth only about US$0.50.",
    "In that year, Japan adopted a gold exchange standard, defining the yen as 0.75 g fine gold or US$0.4985. This exchange rate remained in place until Japan left the gold standard in December 1931, after which the yen fell to $0.30 by July 1932 and to $0.20 by 1933. It remained steady at around $0.30 until the start of the Pacific War on December 7, 1941, at which time it fell to $0.23. The sen and the rin were eventually taken out of circulation at the end of 1953..",
    "No true exchange rate existed for the yen between December 7, 1941, and April 25, 1949; wartime inflation reduced the yen to a fraction of its prewar value.",
    "occupation government fixed the value of the yen at ¥360 per US$ through a United States plan, which was part of the Bretton Woods system, to stabilize prices in the Japanese economy. That exchange rate was maintained until 1971, when the United States abandoned the gold standard, ending a key element of the Bretton Woods system, and setting in motion changes that eventually led to floating exchange rates in 1973.",
    "By 1971, the yen had become undervalued.",
    "The belief that the yen, and several other major currencies, were undervalued motivated the United States' actions in 1971.",
    "After World War II the United States-administered Okinawa issued a higher-valued currency called the B yen from 1946 to 1958, which was then replaced by the U.S.",
    "dollar at the rate of $1 = 120 B yen.",
    "Upon the reversion of Okinawa to Japan in 1972 the Japanese yen then replaced the dollar.",
    "In the 1970s, Japanese government and business people were very concerned that a rise in the value of the yen would hurt export growth by making Japanese products less competitive and would damage the industrial base.",
    "The government, therefore, continued to intervene heavily in foreign-exchange marketing , even after the 1973 decision to allow the yen to float..",
    "Despite intervention, market pressures caused the yen to continue climbing in value, peaking temporarily at an average of ¥271 per US$ in 1973, before the impact of the 1973 oil crisis was felt."

As with other megaherbivores, including the extinct sauropod dinosaurs, the large size of elephants likely developed to allow them to survive on vegetation with low nutritional value. Their limbs grew longer and the feet shorter and broader. The feet were originally plantigrade and developed into a digitigrade stance with cushion pads and the sesamoid bone providing support. Early proboscideans developed longer mandibles and smaller craniums while more derived ones developed shorter mandibles, which shifted the head's centre of gravity.",

    "Elephant trunks have multiple functions, including breathing, olfaction, touching, grasping, and sound production. The animal's sense of smell may be four times as sensitive as that of a bloodhound. The trunk's ability to make powerful twisting and coiling movements allows it to collect food, wrestle with other elephants, and lift up to 350 kg . It can be used for delicate tasks, such as wiping an eye and checking an orifice, and is capable of cracking a peanut shell without breaking the seed. With its trunk, an elephant can reach items at heights of up to 7 m  and dig for water under mud or sand. Individuals may show lateral preference when grasping with their trunks: some prefer to twist them to the left, others to the right. Elephants are capable of dilating their nostrils at a radius of nearly 30%, increasing the nasal volume by 64%, and can inhale at over 150 m/s  which is around 30 times the speed of a human sneeze. Elephants can suck up food and water both to spray in the mouth and, in the case of the latter, to sprinkle on their bodies. An adult Asian elephant is capable of holding 8.5 L  of water in its trunk. They will also spray dust or grass on themselves. When underwater, the elephant uses its trunk as a snorkel.."

    "The prosecution is tasked with providing evidence that establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in order to get a conviction; failure to do so entitles the accused to an acquittal.",
    "Because a defendant is presumed to be innocent, the prosecution has the burden of proving the defendant's guilt on every element of each criminal charge beyond a reasonable doubt. To do so, the prosecution must present compelling evidence that leaves little real doubt in the mind of the trier of fact  that the defendant is almost certainly guilty. For any reasonable doubt to exist, it must come from insufficient evidence, or conflicts within the evidence, that would leave an impartial factfinder less than fully convinced of the defendant's guilt.",
    "Accordingly, the standard of proof forces the factfinder to ignore unreasonable doubts—doubts that are frivolous, hypothetical, or not logically linked to the evidence—and to consider evidence favoring the accused, since reasonable doubt entitles them to an acquittal..",

Reasonable doubt came into existence in English common law and was intended to protect the jurors from committing a potentially mortal sin, since only God may pass judgment on man. The idea was to ease a juror's concern about damnation for passing judgment upon a fellow man. Since there is no formal jury instruction that adequately defines reasonable doubt, and based on the origins of the doctrine and its evolution, reasonable doubt may be resolved by determining whether there exists an alternative explanation to the facts seems plausible. If yes, then there is reasonable doubt and the accused must be acquitted..",

The name Australia was popularised by the explorer Matthew Flinders, who said it was \"more agreeable to the ear, and an assimilation to the names of the other great portions of the Earth\". The first time that Australia appears to have been officially used was in April 1817, when Governor Lachlan Macquarie acknowledged the receipt of Flinders' charts of Australia from Lord Bathurst. In December 1817, Macquarie recommended to the Colonial Office that it be formally adopted. In 1824, the Admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially by that name.

The first recorded European sighting of the Australian mainland, and the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent, are attributed to the Dutch.

He sighted the coast of Cape York Peninsula in early 1606, and made landfall on 26 February 1606 at the Pennefather River near the modern town of Weipa on Cape York. Later that year, Spanish explorer Luís Vaz de Torres sailed through and navigated the Torres Strait Islands. The Dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines and named the island continent \"New Holland\" during the 17th century, and although no attempt at settlement was made, a number of shipwrecks left men either stranded or, as in the case of the Batavia in 1629, marooned for mutiny and murder, thus becoming the first Europeans to permanently inhabit the continent.

    "Backgrounds, characters and other items could be saved separately or as fully composited scenes, with convenient access at later points. \"By creating flat characters and backgrounds in a 3D environment, we are able to add textures and lighting effects that give the film a cut-out construction paper stop-motion style which would have taken many more months if done traditionally,\" stated line producer Gina Shay. By the fifth season, the series transitioned to Maya. The studio now runs a 120-processor render farm that can produce 30 or more shots per hour. The animation of South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut is therefore seen as an example of how South Park's visual quality has improved in recent seasons. In the audio commentary on the 2009 Blu-ray release, Stone and Parker criticize how \"bad and time consuming\" the animation was during that time. IGN described the animation as \"fall somewhere within the middle ground—not quite cardboard cutouts, but not quite fully computerized either.\" Nate Boss, in a review for High-Def Digest, commented, \"There is no comparing the two, as the movie has a classic  animated feel, so full of the cut-outs we have grown to love, while the newer seasons sport a more computer processed feel.\" The film, compared to the series at the time of its production, was animated in widescreen . \"Although the 'primitive' animation of South Park is supposedly a joke, it's really a secret weapon,\" wrote Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.",
    "This release was sourced from the original film negative, which resulted in audio sync issues. IGN's Scott Lowe explained, \"Although clearly aged, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut looks great and is free of the washed out, compressed imperfections of previous standard definition releases of the film.\" However, Michael Zupan of DVDTalk notes that an automatic digital scratch removal process may have inadvertently removed some intentional lines from the picture, notably during Cartman's first scene with the V-chip. In the commentary, Parker and Stone, as well as other crew members, reveal that they had no recollection of making the film due to heavy scheduling..",

Nevertheless, all of the Stones albums since 1989's Steel Wheels had been similarly lauded, and many critics and fans felt that the Stones had yet to record a late-period album truly up to their high standards.",

MCA, responsible for the financial success of the album, favored Tsangarides because of his proven ability to generate an American radio-friendly sound.

    "\"How to Disappear Completely\" is an acoustic ballad backed by orchestral strings and guitar effects.",
    "Considered one of the earliest songs from Kid A , \"How to Disappear Completely\" was written primarily by the Radiohead singer, Thom Yorke, while credited to all of the band members, during the tour for their third album, OK Computer . Yorke began writing it in June 1997, in Toronto, Canada. Later that month, Radiohead performed their then-biggest ever show at the RDS Arena in Dublin, Ireland. The performance was held in windy and rainy conditions. Yorke told Rolling Stone that he had been terrified, and that he had dreamed of running naked down Dublin's River Liffey, pursued by a tidal wave. The dream inspired \"How to Disappear Completely\"; Yorke said later: \"There was nothing I could do.",
    "According to the guitarist Ed O'Brien, \"How to Disappear Completely\" was inspired by the RDS performance and the stress the band members, especially Yorke, experienced on tour. Yorke's experience performing with Radiohead at the 1997 Glastonbury Festival, a week after the RDS performance, was another inspiration. After technical problems, Yorke almost abandoned the show, but continued after urging from O'Brien. Yorke recalled: \"I just needed a break.",
    "singer Michael Stipe, through a telephone conversation on how to deal with his stress from touring by repeating the phrase \"I'm not here, this isn't happening\" to himself. In turn, \"How to Disappear Completely\" inspired Stipe to write the song \"Disappear\" from R.E.M.",
    "album Reveal ; Stipe recounted in 2004 telephoning Yorke to apologize for stealing the concept behind the song, only to find Yorke responding that he had originally inspired him to write \"How to Disappear Completely\"..",
    "After the OK Computer tour ended, Yorke suffered from writer's block and could not finish writing new songs on guitar. \"How to Disappear Completely\" was one of the few songs that was almost completely written prior to the Kid A and Amnesiac recording sessions. In early 1999, Radiohead recorded a version at Guillaume Tell Studios in Paris, but Yorke dismissed it, saying: \"That sounds great, but it sounds like old Radiohead.\" On 27 July, during their sessions at the Batsford Park mansion in Gloucestershire, Radiohead recorded a new demo version. In September, O'Brien denied in his online diary a rumour that Radiohead was collaborating with the post-rock band Godspeed You! Black Emperor on the song..",
    "\"How to Disappear Completely\" is an acoustic-driven ballad backed by \"forlorn\" strings and \"compelling\" guitar effects, with elements of orchestral and ambient music. Several writers emphasized the song as a ballad; others classified it as post-rock. Ryan Pinkard of Tidal Magazine described it as a \"majestic\" pop ballad. Jazz Monroe of The Guardian categorised the song as avant-garde balladry, calling it a \"masterpiece\" that \"orchestrates a stage-fright reverie with fragments of Robert Wyatt and Penderecki.\" Stephen Dalton of Uncut called it as a \"sumptuous\" orchestral ballad. Steve Lowe of Q called the song a \"ghostly waltz-time\" folk song with influences from the Smiths' album Meat Is Murder ..",
    "\"How to Disappear Completely\" is the first track on Kid A that features Yorke's vocals clearly, with no processing effects, unlike the album's first three tracks: \"Everything in Its Right Place\", \"Kid A\" and \"The National Anthem\". The song is played in the key of F♯ minor in a 6\n8 time signature with a tempo of 102 beats per minute , while Yorke's vocals span a range of C♯4 to A5, which he performed in a \"long-drawn-out\" falsetto style. The chord progression follows a sequence of Cadd9–Em–Em6–G–Gsus4–D–Dadd4–EM6.."

    "As a sovereign entity, the Holy See is headquartered in, operates from, and exercises \"exclusive dominion\" over the independent Vatican City State enclave in Rome, of which the pope is sovereign.",
    "The Holy See is administered by the Roman Curia , which is the central government of the Catholic Church. The Roman Curia includes various dicasteries, comparable to ministries and executive departments, with the Cardinal Secretary of State as its chief administrator.",
    "Although the Holy See is sometimes metonymically referred to as the \"Vatican\", the Vatican City State was distinctively established with the Lateran Treaty of 1929, between the Holy See and Italy, to ensure the temporal, diplomatic, and spiritual independence of the papacy. As such, papal nuncios, who are papal diplomats to states and international organizations, are recognized as representing the Holy See and not the Vatican City State, as prescribed in the Canon law of the Catholic Church.",
    "The Holy See is thus viewed as the central government of the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church, in turn, is the largest non-government provider of education and health care in the world..",

    "The term \"Apostolic See\" can refer to any see founded by one of the Twelve Apostles, but, when used with the definite article, it is used in the Catholic Church to refer specifically to the see of the Bishop of Rome, whom that Church sees as the successor of Saint Peter. While Saint Peter's Basilica in Vatican City is perhaps the church most associated with the papacy, the actual cathedral of the Holy See is the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran in the city of Rome..",

    "It also oversees the work of other ecclesiastical tribunals at all levels.

    "However, with the Russian Revolution in 1917, Russia's monarchic rule was abolished and replaced by the Russian SFSR—the world's first constitutionally socialist state.",
    "Following the Russian Civil War, the Russian SFSR established the Soviet Union , within which it was the largest and principal constituent.",
    "With the onset of the Cold War, it competed with the United States for global ideological influence; the Soviet era of the 20th century saw some of the most significant Russian technological achievements, including the first human-made satellite and the first human expedition into outer space.",
    "In 1991, the Russian SFSR emerged from the dissolution of the Soviet Union as the independent Russian Federation.",
    "Ranked worldwide, the Russian economy stands at the ninth-largest by nominal GDP and the sixth-largest by GDP .",
    "In Russian, the current name of the country, Россия , comes from the Byzantine Greek name for Rus', Ρωσσία  – spelled Ρωσία  in Modern Greek. It came into use in the 15th century, though the country was still often referred to by its inhabitants as Rus' or the Russian land until the end of the 17th century. There are two words in Russian which translate to \"Russians\" in English – русские , which refers to ethnic Russians, and россияне , which refers to Russian citizens, regardless of ethnicity..",
    "The ancestors of Russians are among the Slavic tribes that separated from the Proto-Indo-Europeans, who appeared in the northeastern part of Europe c. 1500 years ago. The East Slavs gradually settled western Russia in two waves: one moving from Kiev towards present-day Suzdal and Murom and another from Polotsk towards Novgorod and Rostov.",
    "In the northeast, the Byzantine-Slavic traditions of Kievan Rus' were adapted to form the Russian autocratic state..",
    "The destruction of Kievan Rus' saw the eventual rise of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, initially a part of Vladimir-Suzdal.: 11–20  While still under the domain of the Mongol-Tatars and with their connivance, Moscow began to assert its influence in the region in the early 14th century, gradually becoming the leading force in the \"gathering of the Russian lands\". When the seat of the Metropolitan of the Russian Orthodox Church moved to Moscow in 1325, its influence increased. Moscow's last rival, the Novgorod Republic, prospered as the chief fur trade centre and the easternmost port of the Hanseatic League..",
    "Led by Prince Dmitry Donskoy of Moscow, the united army of Russian principalities inflicted a milestone defeat on the Mongol-Tatars in the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380. Moscow gradually absorbed its parent duchy and surrounding principalities, including formerly strong rivals such as Tver and Novgorod..",
    "Ivan III  finally threw off the control of the Golden Horde and consolidated the whole of northern Rus' under Moscow's dominion, and was the first Russian ruler to take the title \"Grand Duke of all Rus'\".",
    "Ivan III married Sophia Palaiologina, the niece of the last Byzantine emperor Constantine XI, and made the Byzantine double-headed eagle his own, and eventually Russia's, coat-of-arms. Vasili III completed the task of uniting all of Russia by annexing the last few independent Russian states in the early 16th century..",
    "The tsar promulgated a new code of laws , established the first Russian feudal representative body , revamped the military, curbed the influence of the clergy, and reorganised local government. During his long reign, Ivan nearly doubled the already large Russian territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates: Kazan and Astrakhan along the Volga, and the Khanate of Sibir in southwestern Siberia.",
    "The death of Ivan's sons marked the end of the ancient Rurik dynasty in 1598, and in combination with the disastrous famine of 1601–1603, led to a civil war, the rule of pretenders, and foreign intervention during the Time of Troubles in the early 17th century. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, taking advantage, occupied parts of Russia, extending into the capital Moscow. In 1612, the Poles were forced to retreat by the Russian volunteer corps, led by merchant Kuzma Minin and prince Dmitry Pozharsky. The Romanov dynasty acceded to the throne in 1613 by the decision of the Zemsky Sobor, and the country started its gradual recovery from the crisis..",
    "Russia continued its territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of the Cossacks. In 1654, the Ukrainian leader, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian tsar, Alexis; whose acceptance of this offer led to another Russo-Polish War.",
    "Ultimately, Ukraine was split along the Dnieper, leaving the eastern part,  under Russian rule. In the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of vast Siberia continued, hunting for valuable furs and ivory.",
    "Russian explorers pushed eastward primarily along the Siberian River Routes, and by the mid-17th century, there were Russian settlements in eastern Siberia, on the Chukchi Peninsula, along the Amur River, and on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. In 1648, Semyon Dezhnyov became the first European to navigate through the Bering Strait..",
    "During the conflict, Russian troops overran East Prussia, reaching Berlin. However, upon Elizabeth's death, all these conquests were returned to the Kingdom of Prussia by pro-Prussian Peter III of Russia..",
    "Catherine II , who ruled in 1762–1796, presided over the Russian Age of Enlightenment.",
    "She extended Russian political control over the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and annexed most of its territories into Russia, making it the most populous country in Europe. In the south, after the successful Russo-Turkish Wars against the Ottoman Empire, Catherine advanced Russia's boundary to the Black Sea, by dissolving the Crimean Khanate, and annexing Crimea. As a result of victories over Qajar Iran through the Russo-Persian Wars, by the first half of the 19th century, Russia also conquered the Caucasus. Catherine's successor, her son Paul, was unstable and focused predominantly on domestic issues. Following his short reign, Catherine's strategy was continued with Alexander I's  wresting of Finland from the weakened Sweden in 1809, and of Bessarabia from the Ottomans in 1812. In North America, the Russians became the first Europeans to reach and colonise Alaska. In 1803–1806, the first Russian circumnavigation was made. In 1820, a Russian expedition discovered the continent of Antarctica..",
    "The French invasion of Russia at the height of Napoleon's power in 1812 reached Moscow, but eventually failed miserably as the obstinate resistance in combination with the bitterly cold Russian winter led to a disastrous defeat of invaders, in which the pan-European Grande Armée faced utter destruction.",
    "Led by Mikhail Kutuzov and Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly, the Imperial Russian Army ousted Napoleon and drove throughout Europe in the War of the Sixth Coalition, ultimately entering Paris. Alexander I controlled Russia's delegation at the Congress of Vienna, which defined the map of post-Napoleonic Europe..",
    "The officers who pursued Napoleon into Western Europe brought ideas of liberalism back to Russia, and attempted to curtail the tsar's powers during the abortive Decembrist revolt of 1825. At the end of the conservative reign of Nicholas I , a zenith period of Russia's power and influence in Europe, was disrupted by defeat in the Crimean War. Nicholas's successor Alexander II  enacted significant changes throughout the country, including the emancipation reform of 1861. These reforms spurred industrialisation, and modernised the Imperial Russian Army, which liberated much of the Balkans from Ottoman rule in the aftermath of the 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War. During most of the 19th and early 20th century, Russia and Britain colluded over Afghanistan and its neighboring territories in Central and South Asia; the rivalry between the two major European empires came to be known as the Great Game..",
    "Alexander II was assassinated in 1881 by revolutionary terrorists. The reign of his son Alexander III  was less liberal but more peaceful. Under last Russian emperor, Nicholas II , the Revolution of 1905 was triggered by the failure of the humiliating Russo-Japanese War. The uprising was put down, but the government was forced to concede major reforms , including granting freedoms of speech and assembly, the legalisation of political parties, and the creation of an elected legislative body, the State Duma..",
    "In 1914, Russia entered World War I in response to Austria-Hungary's declaration of war on Russia's ally Serbia, and fought across multiple fronts while isolated from its Triple Entente allies. In 1916, the Brusilov Offensive of the Imperial Russian Army almost completely destroyed the Austro-Hungarian Army. However, the already-existing public distrust of the regime was deepened by the rising costs of war, high casualties, and rumors of corruption and treason.",
    "All this formed the climate for the Russian Revolution of 1917, carried out in two major acts. In early 1917, Nicholas II was forced to abdicate; he and his family were imprisoned and later executed in Yekaterinburg during the Russian Civil War. The monarchy was replaced by a shaky coalition of political parties that declared itself the Provisional Government. The Provisional Government proclaimed the Russian Republic in September."

The series premiered on February 6, 2005, following Super Bowl XXXIX, with the rest of the first season airing three months later beginning May 1, 2005. American Dad! is a joint production between Underdog Productions, Fuzzy Door Productions and 20th Television Animation and syndicated by 20th Television.",
    "Creative direction of American Dad! had largely been guided by Barker  and Weitzman as opposed to MacFarlane, resulting in a series that is different from its counterparts. Unlike MacFarlane's other shows, Family Guy and, to a lesser extent, The Cleveland Show, American Dad! does not lean as heavily on the use of cutaway gags, and is less concerned with conventional \"setup-punchline\" jokes, instead deriving its humor mostly from the quirky characters, the relationships between family members, and the relatively relatable plots. While the core issues and resolutions are relatable in most episodes, the show nonetheless weaves in fantastical elements, pitching the tone of the show somewhere between observational comedy and farce. The plots are often absurd, but grounded by family stories and real-world issues..",
    "American Dad! has been nominated for numerous awards, including four Primetime Emmy Awards and two Annie Awards.",
    "Since its debut, American Dad! has broadcast 344 episodes .",

    "American Dad! centers on the absurd circumstances, adventures and domestic life of its title character Stan Smith, his immediate family, and their four housemates.",
    "When asked what first spurred the idea for American Dad! Seth MacFarlane answered, \"It was right after the  election, and me and co-creator Matt Weitzman were so frustrated with the Bush administration that we would just spend days bitching and complaining, and we figured we should channel this into something creative and hopefully profitable.\" In early February 2005, Barker stated, \"About a year and a half ago, Seth called and asked if Matt and I would be interested in working on a show about a right-wing CIA agent and his liberal daughter.",
    "It was right up our alley, and everything just fell into place.\" On September 14, 2003, Variety reported that Fox Broadcasting had ordered a pilot presentation of the then tentatively titled American Dad! and \"If greenlit, American Dad! could launch as early as fall 2004.\" At the time, Fox was aiming to develop a new lineup of adult animated sitcoms..",
    "American Dad! had a mid-season debut.",
    "American Dad! was originally intended to be Fox's answer to the hordes of fans left behind from the original failure of MacFarlane's previous animated venture. Just three short months after American Dad!'s debut however, Family Guy was revived, leaving American Dad! with a formidable expectation: whether the series could distinguish itself from its counterpart and succeed on its own merits. Instead of taking over creative direction of the series, MacFarlane left the job largely in the hands of Barker and Weitzman so as to distinguish American Dad!.",
    "In its early going, American Dad! brought in strong ratings but fought an uphill battle in gaining widespread acceptance and approval from viewers and critics alike. The popularity of MacFarlane and his involvement with Family Guy had led to foregone conclusions and prejudices against American Dad! as a rip-off of the predecessor and some critics had already written off American Dad! prior to its birth as nothing more than a pale imitation of Family Guy and MacFarlane's attempts to get his old show back on the air. One example, prior to the American Dad! series debut, a writer of The Washington Post published a piece that reads \"But those same executives have also given MacFarlane a whole new animated half-hour to play with in the disappointing American Dad! The new series officially premieres in May but has a sneak preview tomorrow night in the coveted post-Super Bowl time period ..",

    "American Dad! in its original form was even said to have been inspired by All in the Family..",
    "In American Dad!'s initial seasons MacFarlane was described as focusing more attention on his coexisting obligation of Family Guy.",
    "This was to the extent that American Dad! was completely secondary to him, and he did not understand the show.",
    "After American Dad!'s initial couple of seasons and as it progressed, the show began to increasingly develop its very own distinct approach and identity, becoming more and more distinguished from all other programs on the air.",
    "After the show's first several seasons, MacFarlane not only came to fully understand and appreciate American Dad!'s value but also came to consider himself a huge fan of the series.",
    "Taking note of his Twitter followers increased fanaticism and excitement over American Dad! and the \"Roger\" character, MacFarlane began putting considerable amounts of his time and efforts into the series, more so in the last several seasons than ever before . In describing American Dad! comedy styles, Barker noted that it is not as reference-laden as Family Guy or South Park.",
    "He added that American Dad!'s humor more frequently derives from \"the human condition and emotions that everyone can relate to: ego, the feds, etc."

According to Richard Nelson Frye, a leading historian of Iranian and Central Asian history, the Persian emigration to Central Asia may be considered the beginning of the modern Tajik nation, and ethnic Persians, along with some elements of the Eastern Iranian Bactrians and Sogdians, as the main ancestors of the modern Tajiks.

    "Cognitive psychology aims to understand thought as a form of information processing.",

    "The term \"law of thought\" refers to three fundamental laws of logic: the law of contradiction, the law of excluded middle, and the principle of identity.",
    "Thought experiments often employ counterfactual thinking in order to illustrate theories or to test their plausibility.",
    "The terms \"thought\" and \"thinking\" refer to a wide variety of psychological activities. In their most common sense, they are understood as conscious processes that can happen independently of sensory stimulation. This includes various different mental processes, like considering an idea or proposition or judging it to be true.",
    "In this sense, memory and imagination are forms of thought but perception is not. In a more restricted sense, only the most paradigmatic cases are considered thought.",
    "These involve conscious processes that are conceptual or linguistic and sufficiently abstract, like judging, inferring, problem solving, and deliberating. Sometimes the terms \"thought\" and \"thinking\" are understood in a very wide sense as referring to any form of mental process, conscious or unconscious. In this sense, they may be used synonymously with the term \"mind\".",
    "This usage is encountered, for example, in the Cartesian tradition, where minds are understood as thinking things, and in the cognitive sciences. But this sense may include the restriction that such processes have to lead to intelligent behavior to be considered thought. A contrast sometimes found in the academic literature is that between thinking and feeling.",
    "The terms \"thought\" and \"thinking\" can also be used to refer not to the mental processes themselves but to mental states or systems of ideas brought about by these processes. In this sense, they are often synonymous with the term \"belief\" and its cognates and may refer to the mental states which either belong to an individual or are common among a certain group of people. Discussions of thought in the academic literature often leave it implicit which sense of the term they have in mind.",
    "The word thought comes from Old English þoht, or geþoht, from the stem of þencan \"to conceive of in the mind, consider\"..",
    "This means, for example, distinguishing beauty itself from derivative images of beauty. One problem for this view is to explain how humans can learn and think about Platonic forms belonging to a different realm. Plato himself tries to solve this problem through his theory of recollection, according to which the soul already was in contact with the Platonic forms before and is therefore able to remember what they are like. But this explanation depends on various assumptions usually not accepted in contemporary thought..",
    "Aristotelians hold that the mind is able to think about something by instantiating the essence of the object of thought. So while thinking about trees, the mind instantiates tree-ness.",
    "Some of these concepts may be innate, but most have to be learned through abstraction from sense experience before they can be used in thought..",
    "It has been argued against these views that they have problems in accounting for the logical form of thought.",
    "The knowledge a person has of their thoughts can be explained as a form of overhearing one's own silent monologue. Three central aspects are often ascribed to inner speech: it is in an important sense similar to hearing sounds, it involves the use of language and it constitutes a motor plan that could be used for actual speech. This connection to language is supported by the fact that thinking is often accompanied by muscle activity in the speech organs.",
    "This theory is known as the language of thought hypothesis..",
    "Inner speech theory has a strong initial plausibility since introspection suggests that indeed many thoughts are accompanied by inner speech."

After the decline of Sepúlveda, another concejo north of the mountain range, Segovia had become a major actor south of the Guadarrama mountains, expanding across the Lozoya and Manzanares rivers to the north of Madrid and along the Guadarrama river course to its west..",

Unlike other European capitals, during the first half of the 19th century the only noticeable bourgeois elements in Madrid  were merchants. The University of Alcalá de Henares was relocated to Madrid in 1836, becoming the Central University..",

The tertiary sector, including banking, insurance and telephone services, grew greatly. Illiteracy rates were down to below 20%, and the city's cultural life grew notably during the so-called Silver Age of Spanish Culture; the sales of newspapers also increased. Conversely, the proclamation of the Republic created a severe housing shortage.",

    "The goat or domestic goat  is a domesticated species of goat-antelope typically kept as livestock.",
    "It was domesticated from the wild goat (C.",
    "The goat is a member of the animal family Bovidae and the tribe Caprini, meaning it is closely related to the sheep.",
    "There are over 300 distinct breeds of goat. It is one of the oldest domesticated species of animal, according to archaeological evidence that its earliest domestication occurred in Iran at 10,000 calibrated calendar years ago..",
    "Goats have been used for milk, meat, fur, and skins across much of the world. Milk from goats is often turned into goat cheese.",
    "Female goats are referred to as does or nannies, intact males are called bucks or billies, and juvenile goats of both sexes are called kids.",
    "While the words hircine and caprine both refer to anything having a goat-like quality, hircine is used most often to emphasize the distinct smell of domestic goats.",
    "In 2011, there were more than 924 million goats living in the world, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization..",
    "The Modern English word goat comes from Old English gāt \"she-goat, goat in general\", which in turn derives from Proto-Germanic *gaitaz (cf.",
    "Norwegian/Icelandic geit, German Geiß, and Gothic gaits), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *ǵʰaidos meaning \"young goat\" (cf.",
    "Nanny goat  originated in the 18th century, and billy goat  originated in the 19th century..",
    "Goats are among the earliest animals domesticated by humans. The most recent genetic analysis confirms the archaeological evidence that the wild bezoar ibex of the Zagros Mountains is the likely original ancestor of probably all domestic goats today..",
    "Neolithic farmers began to herd wild goats primarily for easy access to milk and meat, as well as to their dung, which was used as fuel; and their bones, hair, and sinew were used for clothing, building, and tools. The earliest remnants of domesticated goats dating 10,000 years Before Present are found in Ganj Dareh in Iran. Goat remains have been found at archaeological sites in Jericho, Choga Mami, Djeitun, and Çayönü, dating the domestication of goats in Western Asia at between 8,000 and 9,000 years ago..",
    "Historically, goat hide has been used for water and wine bottles in both traveling and transporting wine for sale.",
    "Each recognized breed of goat has specific weight ranges, which vary from over 140 kg  for bucks of larger breeds such as the Boer, to 20 to 27 kg  for smaller goat does. Within each breed, different strains or bloodlines may have different recognized sizes.",
    "Most goats naturally have two horns, of various shapes and sizes depending on the breed. There have been incidents of polycerate goats , although this is a genetic rarity thought to be inherited.",
    "Unlike cattle, goats have not been successfully bred to be reliably polled, as the genes determining sex and those determining horns are closely linked.",
    "Breeding together two genetically polled goats results in a high number of intersex individuals among the offspring, which are typically sterile. Their horns are made of living bone surrounded by keratin and other proteins, and are used for defense, dominance, and territoriality..",
    "Goats are ruminants.",
    "The females have an udder consisting of two teats, in contrast to cattle, which have four teats. An exception to this is the Boer goat, which sometimes may have up to eight teats..",
    "Goats have horizontal, slit-shaped pupils.",
    "Because goats' irises are usually pale, their contrasting pupils are much more noticeable than in animals such as cattle, deer, most horses, and many sheep, whose similarly horizontal pupils blend into a dark iris and sclera..",
    "Goats have no tear ducts..",
    "Both male and female goats may have beards, and many types of goat  may have wattles, one dangling from each side of the neck..",
    "Goats expressing the tan pattern have coats pigmented completely with pheomelanin .",
    "The allele which codes for this pattern is located at the agouti locus of the goat genome.",
    "There are multiple modifier genes which control how much tan pigment is actually expressed, so a tan-patterned goat can have a coat ranging from pure white to deep red..",
    "Goats reach puberty between three and 15 months of age, depending on breed and nutritional status.",
    "In equatorial regions, goats are able to breed at any time of the year.",
    "Rut is characterized by a decrease in appetite and obsessive interest in the does. A buck in rut will display flehmen lip curling and will urinate on his forelegs and face. Sebaceous scent glands at the base of the horns add to the male goat's odor, which is important to make him attractive to the female."

    "The Lightning team was temporarily moved to the 3G Distillery, a smelly former bourbon works where the first YP-38  was built. In November 1941, Kelsey gave the unofficial nod to Johnson and the P-38 team to engineer a drop tank system to extend range for the fighter, and they completed the initial research and development without a contract.",

    "In 2009, the Skunk Works was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum..",
    "The term \"Skunk Works\" came from Al Capp's satirical, hillbilly comic strip Li’l Abner, which was immensely popular from 1935 through the 1950s. The “Skonk Works\" was a dilapidated factory located on the remote outskirts of Dogpatch, in the backwoods of Kentucky.",
    "According to the strip, scores of locals were done in yearly by the toxic fumes of the concentrated \"skonk oil\", which was brewed and barreled daily by \"Big Barnsmell\" , by grinding dead skunks and worn shoes into a smoldering still, for some mysterious, unspecified purpose.",
    "In mid-1939 when Lockheed was expanding rapidly, the YP-38 project was moved a few blocks away to the newly purchased 3G Distillery, also known as Three G or GGG Distillery. Lockheed took over the building but the sour smell of bourbon mash lingered, partly because the group of buildings continued to store barrels of aging whiskey. The first YP-38 was built there before the team moved back to Lockheed's main factory a year later. In 1964, Johnson told Look magazine that the bourbon distillery was the first of five Lockheed skunk works locations..",
    "To comment on the smell and the secrecy the project entailed, another engineer, Irv Culver, referred to the facility as \"Skonk Works\".",

  "writing": [
    "Writing is a neuropsychological activity involving cognitive and physical processes and the use of writing systems to structure and translate human thoughts into persistent representations of human language.",
    "A system of writing relies on many of the same semantic structures as the language it represents, such as lexicon and syntax, with the added dependency of a system of symbols representing that language's phonology and morphology.",
    "The outcome of this activity, also called \"writing\", and sometimes a \"text\", is a series of physically inscribed, mechanically transferred, or digitally represented linguistic symbols.",
    "Writing systems do not themselves constitute languages ; they are a means of rendering language into a form that can be reconstructed by other humans separated by time and/or space. While not all languages use a writing system, those that do can complement and extend capacities of spoken language by creating durable forms of language that can be transmitted across space (e.g.",
    "libraries or other public records). Writing can also have knowledge-transforming effects, since it allows humans to externalize their thinking in forms that are easier to reflect on, elaborate, reconsider, and revise..",
    "Any instance of writing involves a complex interaction among available tools, intentions, cultural customs, genres, tacit and explicit knowledge, and the constraints and limitations of the writing system deployed. Inscriptions have been made with fingers, styluses, quills, ink brushes, pencils, pens, and many styles of lithography; surfaces used for these inscriptions include stone tablets, clay tablets, bamboo slats, papyrus, wax tablets, vellum, parchment, paper, copperplate, slate, porcelain and other enameled surfaces.",
    "The Incas used knotted cords known as quipu  for keeping records. Writing tools and surfaces have been countlessly improvised throughout history .",
    "The typewriter and subsequently various digital word processors have recently become widespread writing tools, and studies have compared the ways in which writers have framed the experience of writing with such tools as compared with the pen or pencil. Advancements in natural language generation allow certain tools  to produce certain kinds of highly formulaic writing  without the direct involvement of humans. Writing technologies from different eras coexist easily in many homes and workplaces.",
    "During the course of a day or even a single episode of writing, for example, a writer might instinctively switch among a pencil, a touchscreen, a text-editor, a whiteboard, a legal pad, and adhesive notes as different purposes arise..",
    "As human societies emerged, collective motivations for the development of writing were driven by pragmatic exigencies like keeping track of produce and other wealth, recording history, maintaining culture, codifying knowledge through curricula and lists of texts deemed to contain foundational knowledge  or to be artistically exceptional , organizing and governing societies through the formation of legal systems, census records, contracts, deeds of ownership, taxation, trade agreements, treaties, and so on. Amateur historians, including H.G.",
    "Wells, had speculated since the early 20th century on the likely correspondence between the emergence of systems of writing and the development of city-states into empires. As Charles Bazerman explains, the \"marking of signs on stones, clay, paper, and now digital memories—each more portable and rapidly traveling than the previous—provided means for increasingly coordinated and extended action as well as memory across larger groups of people over time and space.\" For example, around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration in Mesopotamia outgrew human memory, and writing became a more dependable method for the permanent recording and presentation of transactions. In both ancient Egypt and Mesoamerica, on the other hand, writing may have evolved through calendric and political necessities for recording historical and environmental events. Further innovations included more uniform, predictable, and widely dispersed legal systems, distribution of accessible versions of sacred texts, and furthering practices of scientific inquiry and knowledge-consolidation, all largely reliant on portable and easily reproducible forms of inscribed language.",
    "The history of writing is co-extensive with the history of uses of writing and the elaboration of activity systems which give rise to and circulate writing.",
    "Individual, as opposed to collective, motivations for writing include improvised additional capacity for the limitations of human memory , dissemination of ideas , imaginative narratives and other forms of storytelling, maintaining kinship and other social networks, negotiating household matters with providers of goods and services and with local and regional governing bodies, and lifewriting .",
    "The nearly global spread of digital communication systems such as e-mail and social media has made writing an increasingly important feature of daily life, where these systems mix with older technologies like paper, pencils, whiteboards, printers, and copiers. Substantial amounts of everyday writing characterize most workplaces in developed countries. In many occupations  written documentation is not only the main deliverable but also the mode of work itself. Even in occupations not typically associated with writing, routine workflows  have most employees writing at least some of the time..",
    "The following section offers examples of how writing constitutes much of the labor of many modern careers.",
    "Some professions are typically associated with writing, such as literary authors, journalists, and technical writers, but writing is pervasive in most modern forms of work, civic participation, household management, and leisure activities. The following are examples of this pervasiveness, but are far from encompassing all the uses of writing.",
    "Writing permeates everyday commerce.",
    "Technical writing and medical writing are recognized writing specialties that address the needs of scientifically and technologically based professions for precise, accurate, and timely communications internally and externally for the publics the professions serve.",
    "Both in the writing they do and with the support they provide other professionals within their organizations they make sure that each person within the organization has the information they need, and that the work of the organization is coordinated by making sure all necessary tasks are assigned and carried out in a timely and accurate way.",
    "A certain subset of these works gain scholarly attention and are taught in literature classes at schools at all levels, including children’s literature, young adult literature, and canonical literature taught at universities; these works typically become the subject of another form of writing: academic scholarship.",
    "Formal education is the social context most strongly associated with the learning of writing, and students may carry these particular associations long after leaving school. Alongside the writing that students read  students do much writing within schools at all levels, on subject exams, in essays, in taking notes, in doing homework, and in formative and summative assessments.",
    " Some of this is explicitly directed toward the learning of writing, but much is focused more on subject learning. Students receive much writing from their teachers as well in the forms of assignments and syllabi, directions for activities, worksheets, corrections on work, or information about subjects or exams.",
    "Writing also pervades schools and educational institutions in less visible and memorable ways. Since schools are typically hierarchically arranged bureaucracies, writing also circulates in the forms of notices and regulations that teachers receive from their supervisors and arrange their instruction according to district and state syllabi and regulations.",
    "The major writing systems broadly fall into four categories: logographic, syllabic, alphabetic, and featural.",
    "As pictograms do not represent a language's sounds, they have been argued not to constitute a writing system..",
    "Other languages that use syllabic writing include the Linear B script for Mycenaean Greek; Cherokee, Ndjuka, an English-based creole language of Suriname; and the Vai script of Liberia.",
    "However, as languages often evolve independently of their writing systems, and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for, the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language.",
    "Writing systems based primarily on writing just consonants phonemes date back to the hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt.",
    "Another featural script is SignWriting, the most popular writing system for many sign languages, where the shapes and movements of the hands and face are represented iconically.",

    "Neolithic farmers began to herd wild goats primarily for easy access to milk and meat, as well as to their dung, which was used as fuel; and their bones, hair, and sinew were used for clothing, building, and tools. The earliest remnants of domesticated goats dating 10,000 years Before Present are found in Ganj Dareh in Iran.

Since the irrational emotions as stirred up in literature threaten the rationality of human beings, in The Republic Plato expelled poets from the state..",
    "In the later history of philosophy this opposition of rationality and the irrational was renewed as a methodological differentiation by Descartes, but reversed by Pascal in his statement: \"Le coeur a ses raisons, que la raison ne connait point\" . Pascal thus asserted a specific rationality of the \"irrational\" emotions.",

    "Existing on a dialect continuum with Scots and then most closely related to the Low German and Frisian languages, English is genealogically Germanic.",
    "However, its vocabulary also shows major influences from French  and Latin , plus some grammar and a small amount of core vocabulary influenced by Old Norse . Speakers of English are called Anglophones.",
    "The earliest forms of English, collectively known as \"Old English\", evolved from a group of North Sea Germanic dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century and further mutated by Norse-speaking Viking settlers starting in the 8th and 9th centuries.",
    "Middle English began in the late 11th century after the Norman Conquest of England, when considerable Old French  and Latin-derived vocabulary was incorporated into English over some three hundred years. Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the start of the Great Vowel Shift and the Renaissance trend of borrowing further Latin and Greek words and roots into English, concurrent with the introduction of the printing press to London.",
    "Modern English grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European dependent-marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection and a fairly fixed subject–verb–object word order. Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses, aspects and moods, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives, and some negation.",
    "Modern English has spread around the world since the 17th century as a consequence of the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States of America.",
    "Through all types of printed and electronic media in these countries, English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science, navigation, and law. English is the most spoken language in the world and the third-most spoken native language in the world, after Standard Chinese and Spanish. It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in 59 sovereign states.",

English is the majority native language in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the Republic of Ireland  and is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean, Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. It is the co-official language of the United Nations, the European Union, and many other international and regional organisations.",

    "Low German/Low Saxon is also closely related, and sometimes English, the Frisian languages, and Low German are grouped together as the Ingvaeonic  languages, though this grouping remains debated. Old English evolved into Middle English, which in turn evolved into Modern English. Particular dialects of Old and Middle English also developed into a number of other Anglic languages, including Scots and the extinct Fingallian and Forth and Bargy  dialects of Ireland..",

    "Unlike Icelandic and Faroese, which were isolated, the development of English was influenced by a long series of invasions of the British Isles by other peoples and languages, particularly Old Norse and Norman French.",
    "These left a profound mark of their own on the language, so that English shows some similarities in vocabulary and grammar with many languages outside its linguistic clades—but it is not mutually intelligible with any of those languages either.",
    "Some scholars have argued that English can be considered a mixed language or a creole—a theory called the Middle English creole hypothesis.",

    "English is classified as a Germanic language because it shares innovations with other Germanic languages such as Dutch, German, and Swedish. These shared innovations show that the languages have descended from a single common ancestor called Proto-Germanic.",
    "English is classified as an Anglo-Frisian language because Frisian and English share other features, such as the palatalisation of consonants that were velar consonants in Proto-Germanic ..",
    "The earliest form of English is called Old English or Anglo-Saxon .",
    "Old English developed from a set of West Germanic dialects, often grouped as Anglo-Frisian or North Sea Germanic, and originally spoken along the coasts of Frisia, Lower Saxony and southern Jutland by Germanic peoples known to the historical record as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. From the 5th century, the Anglo-Saxons settled Britain as the Roman economy and administration collapsed.",

    "Old English was divided into four dialects: the Anglian dialects  and the Saxon dialects, Kentish and West Saxon. Through the educational reforms of King Alfred in the 9th century and the influence of the kingdom of Wessex, the West Saxon dialect became the standard written variety. The epic poem Beowulf is written in West Saxon, and the earliest English poem, Cædmon's Hymn, is written in Northumbrian. Modern English developed mainly from Mercian, but the Scots language developed from Northumbrian.",

Peter Fonda had become \"an icon of the counterculture\" in The Wild Angels , where he established \"a persona he would develop further in The Trip and Easy Rider.\" The Trip also popularized LSD, while Easy Rider went on to \"celebrate '60s counterculture\" but does so \"stripped of its innocence.\" Author Katie Mills wrote that The Trip is a way point along the \"metamorphosis of the rebel road story from a Beat relic into its hippie reincarnation as Easy Rider\", and connected Peter Fonda's characters in those two films, along with his character in The Wild Angels, deviating from the \"formulaic biker\" persona and critiquing \"commodity-oriented filmmakers appropriating avant-garde film techniques.\" It was also a step in the transition from independent film into Hollywood's mainstream, and while The Trip was criticized as a faux, popularized underground film made by Hollywood insiders, Easy Rider \"interrogates\" the attitude that underground film must \"remain strictly segregated from Hollywood.\" Mills also wrote that the famous acid trip scene in Easy Rider \"clearly derives from their first tentative explorations as filmmakers in The Trip.\" The Trip and The Wild Angels had been low-budget films released by American International Pictures and were both successful.",

The word Cheral refers to the oldest known dynasty of Kerala kings and is derived from the Proto-Tamil-Malayalam word for 'lake'.

Archaeological studies have identified Mesolithic, Neolithic and Megalithic sites in Kerala. The studies point to the development of ancient Kerala society and its culture beginning from the Paleolithic Age, through the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Megalithic Ages. Foreign cultural contacts have assisted this cultural formation; historians suggest a possible relationship with Indus Valley civilization during the late Bronze Age and early Iron Age.."

    "Many programming languages and software development tools also offer programs to aid in debugging, known as debuggers.",
    "The terms \"bug\" and \"debugging\" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. While she was working on a Mark II computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were \"debugging\" the system.",
    "Similarly, the term \"debugging\" seems to have been used as a term in aeronautics before entering the world of computers.",

    "By 1963 \"debugging\" was a common-enough term to be mentioned in passing without explanation on page 1 of the CTSS manual..",
    "As software and electronic systems have become generally more complex, the various common debugging techniques have expanded with more methods to detect anomalies, assess impact, and schedule software patches or full updates to a system.",
    "Considering the collateral issues, such as the cost-versus-benefit impact assessment, then broader debugging techniques will expand to determine the frequency of anomalies  to help assess their impact to the overall system.",
    "Debugging ranges in complexity from fixing simple errors to performing lengthy and tiresome tasks of data collection, analysis, and scheduling updates.",
    "The debugging skill of the programmer can be a major factor in the ability to debug a problem, but the difficulty of software debugging varies greatly with the complexity of the system, and also depends, to some extent, on the programming language used and the available tools, such as debuggers.",
    "The term debugger can also refer to the person who is doing the debugging.",
    "Generally, high-level programming languages, such as Java, make debugging easier, because they have features such as exception handling and type checking that make real sources of erratic behaviour easier to spot.",
    "For debugging electronic hardware  as well as low-level software  and firmware, instruments such as oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, or in-circuit emulators  are often used, alone or in combination.",
    "The debugging process normally begins with identifying the steps to reproduce the problem.",
    "When debugging in a GUI, the programmer can try skipping some user interaction from the original problem description to check if the remaining actions are sufficient for causing the bug to occur.",
    "Not only does this fact make life tough for embedded system developers, it also makes debugging and testing of these systems harder as well, since different debugging tools are needed for different platforms.",
    "In addition to the typical task of identifying bugs in the system, embedded system debugging also seeks to collect information about the operating states of the system that may then be used to analyze the system: to find ways to boost its performance or to optimize other important characteristics (e.g.",
    "Anti-debugging is \"the implementation of one or more techniques within computer code that hinders attempts at reverse engineering or debugging a target process\".

His mother, Edna Blow Ragland \"Rassy\" Young  was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Although Canadian, his mother had American and French ancestry. Young's parents married in 1940 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and moved to Toronto shortly thereafter where their first son, Robert \"Bob\" Young, was born in 1942.",
    "Shortly after Young's birth in 1945, the family moved to rural Omemee, Ontario, which Young later described fondly as a \"sleepy little place\". Young contracted polio in the late summer of 1951 during the last major outbreak of the disease in Ontario, and as a result became partially paralyzed on his left side. After the conclusion of his hospitalization, the Young family wintered in Florida, whose milder weather they believed would help Neil's convalescence. During that period, Young briefly attended Faulkner Elementary School in New Smyrna Beach, Florida.",

The Squires primarily performed in Winnipeg and rural Manitoba in towns such as Selkirk, Neepawa, Brandon and Giroux , with a few shows in northern Ontario..",

It includes some commentary by his friend and fellow cartoonist Seth, who disagrees with Brown's position and accuses him of having no emotions, but then goes on to say, \"The funny thing about Chester is that out of all the men I know he’s quite possibly the one I think would make the most considerate boyfriend or husband for a woman...and yet he is the one who picked the whoring.\".",

In 1813, the city returned to Austria and from 1815 to 1849 was the administrative centre of the Kingdom of Illyria in the Austrian Empire. In 1821, it hosted the Congress of Laibach, which fixed European political borders for that period. The first train arrived in 1849 from Vienna and in 1857 the line extended to Trieste..",

During the subsequent reconstruction, some districts were rebuilt in the Vienna Secession style. Public electric lighting arrived in 1898.",

  "walking": [
    "Walking  is one of the main gaits of terrestrial locomotion among legged animals.",
    "Walking is typically slower than running and other gaits.",
    "Walking is defined by an 'inverted pendulum' gait in which the body vaults over the stiff limb or limbs with each step.",
    "In humans and other bipeds, walking is generally distinguished from running in that only one foot at a time leaves contact with the ground and there is a period of double-support.",
    "This distinction has the status of a formal requirement in competitive walking events.",
    "For quadrupedal species, there are numerous gaits which may be termed walking or running, and distinctions based upon the presence or absence of a suspended phase or the number of feet in contact any time do not yield mechanically correct classification. The most effective method to distinguish walking from running is to measure the height of a person's centre of mass using motion capture or a force plate at midstance.",
    "During walking, the centre of mass reaches a maximum height at midstance, while running, it is then at a minimum.",
    "For walking up grades above 10%, this distinction no longer holds for some individuals.",
    "Definitions based on the percentage of the stride during which a foot is in contact with the ground  of greater than 50% contact corresponds well with identification of 'inverted pendulum' mechanics and are indicative of walking for animals with any number of limbs, although this definition is incomplete. Running humans and animals may have contact periods greater than 50% of a gait cycle when rounding corners, running uphill or carrying loads.",
    "Speed is another factor that distinguishes walking from running.",
    "Although walking speeds can vary greatly depending on many factors such as height, weight, age, terrain, surface, load, culture, effort, and fitness, the average human walking speed at crosswalks is about 5.0 kilometres per hour , or about 1.4 meters per second , or about 3.1 miles per hour .",
    "Specific studies have found pedestrian walking speeds at crosswalks ranging from 4.51 to 4.75 km/h  for older individuals and from 5.32 to 5.43 km/h  for younger individuals; a brisk walking speed can be around 6.5 km/h . In Japan, the standard measure for walking speed is 80 m/min .",
    "An average human child achieves independent walking ability at around 11 months old..",
    "Regular, brisk exercise of any kind can improve confidence, stamina, energy, weight control and life expectancy and reduces stress. It can also decrease the risk of coronary heart disease, strokes, diabetes, high blood pressure, bowel cancer and osteoporosis. Scientific studies have also shown that walking, besides its physical benefits, is also beneficial for the mind, improving memory skills, learning ability, concentration, mood, creativity, and abstract reasoning. Sustained walking sessions for a minimum period of thirty to sixty minutes a day, five days a week, with the correct walking posture, reduce health risks and have various overall health benefits, such as reducing the chances of cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, anxiety disorder and depression. Life expectancy is also increased even for individuals suffering from obesity or high blood pressure.",
    "Walking also improves bone health, especially strengthening the hip bone, and lowering the harmful low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol, and raising the useful high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol. Studies have found that walking may also help prevent dementia and Alzheimer's. Walking at a pace that increases ones heart rate to 70% of their maximum heart rate, also known as the \"fat-burning heart rate\" can cause the body to utilize its fat reserves for energy leading to fat loss. An individual's maximum heart rate can be calculated by subtracting their age from 220.",
    "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's fact sheet on the \"Relationship of Walking to Mortality Among U.S.",
    "Women who took 4,500 steps to 7,500 steps a day seemed to have fewer premature deaths compared to those who only took 2,700 steps a day. \"Walking lengthened the life of people with diabetes regardless of age, sex, race, body mass index, length of time since diagnosis and presence of complications or functional limitations.\" It has been suggested that there is a relationship between the speed of walking and health, and that the best results are obtained with a speed of more than 2.5 mph ..",
    "Governments now recognize the benefits of walking for mental and physical health and are actively encouraging it.",
    "This growing emphasis on walking has arisen because people walk less nowadays than previously.",
    "Many professionals in local authorities and the National Health Service are employed to halt this decline by ensuring that the built environment allows people to walk and that there are walking opportunities available to them.",
    "Professionals working to encourage walking come mainly from six sectors: health, transport, environment, schools, sport and recreation, and urban design.",
    "One program to encourage walking is \"The Walking the Way to Health Initiative\", organized by the British walkers association The Ramblers, which is the largest volunteer led walking scheme in the United Kingdom.",
    "The scheme has trained over 35,000 volunteers and has over 500 schemes operating across the UK, with thousands of people walking every week. A new organization called \"Walk England\" launched a web site in June 2008 to provide these professionals with evidence, advice, and examples of success stories of how to encourage communities to walk more.",
    "The site has a social networking aspect to allow professionals and the public to ask questions, post news and events, and communicate with others in their area about walking, as well as a \"walk now\" option to find out what walks are available in each region.",
    "Similar organizations exist in other countries and recently a \"Walking Summit\" was held in the United States.",
    "This \"assembled thought-leaders and influencers from business, urban planning and real estate,  physicians and public health officials\", and others, to discuss how to make American cities and communities places where \"people can and want to walk\". Walking is more prevalent in European cities that have dense residential areas mixed with commercial areas and good public transportation..",
    "It is theorized that \"walking\" among tetrapods originated underwater with air-breathing fish that could \"walk\" underwater, giving rise  to the plethora of land-dwelling life that walk on four or two limbs. While terrestrial tetrapods are theorised to have a single origin, arthropods and their relatives are thought to have independently evolved walking several times, specifically in insects, myriapods, chelicerates, tardigrades, onychophorans, and crustaceans. Little skates, members of the demersal fish community, can propel themselves by pushing off the ocean floor with their pelvic fins, using neural mechanisms which evolved as early as 420 million years ago, before vertebrates set foot on land..",
    "Data in the fossil record indicate that among hominin ancestors, bipedal walking was one of the first defining characteristics to emerge, predating other defining characteristics of Hominidae. Judging from footprints discovered on a former shore in Kenya, it is thought possible that ancestors of modern humans were walking in ways very similar to the present activity as long as 3 million years ago..",
    "Today, the walking gait of humans is unique and differs significantly from bipedal or quadrupedal walking gaits of other primates, like chimpanzees.",
    "Human walking has been found to be slightly more energy efficient than travel for a quadrupedal mammal of a similar size, like chimpanzees. The energy efficiency of human locomotion can be accounted for by the reduced use of muscle in walking, due to an upright posture which places ground reaction forces at the hip and knee. When walking bipedally, chimpanzees take a crouched stance with bent knees and hips, forcing the quadriceps muscles to perform extra work and consequently costs more energy. Comparing chimpanzee quadrupedal travel to that of true quadrupedal animals has indicated that chimpanzees expend one-hundred and fifty percent of the energy required for travel compared to true quadrupeds."

Niece entered Middle English from the Old French word nece, which also derives from Latin nepotem. The word nibling is a neologism suggested by Samuel Martin in 1951 as a cover term for \"nephew or niece\"; it is not common outside of specialist literature. Sometimes in discussions involving analytic material or in abstract literature, terms such as male nibling and female nibling are preferred to describe nephews and nieces respectively. Terms such as nibling are also sometimes viewed as a gender-neutral alternative to terms which may be viewed as perpetuating the overgenderization of the English language..",

    "Horses are adapted to run, allowing them to quickly escape predators, and possess an excellent sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response.",
    "Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults. Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth.",
    "Most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four.",
    "Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited \"hot bloods\" with speed and endurance; \"cold bloods\", such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and \"warmbloods\", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe.",

Larger-riding horses usually start at about 15.2 hands  and often are as tall as 17 hands , weighing from 500 to 600 kilograms . Heavy or draft horses are usually at least 16 hands  high and can be as tall as 18 hands  high.",

    "The basic coat colors of chestnut and black are determined by the gene controlled by the Melanocortin 1 receptor, also known as the \"extension gene\" or \"red factor,\" as its recessive form is \"red\"  and its dominant form is black. Additional genes control suppression of black color to point coloration that results in a bay, spotting patterns such as pinto or leopard, dilution genes such as palomino or dun, as well as greying, and all the other factors that create the many possible coat colors found in horses..",
    "Horses that have a white coat color are often mislabeled; a horse that looks \"white\" is usually a middle-aged or older gray.",
    "The only horses properly called white are born with a predominantly white hair coat and pink skin, a fairly rare occurrence. Different and unrelated genetic factors can produce white coat colors in horses, including several different alleles of dominant white and the sabino-1 gene. However, there are no \"albino\" horses, defined as having both pink skin and red eyes..",
    "Gestation lasts approximately 340 days, with an average range 320–370 days, and usually results in one foal; twins are rare. Horses are a precocial species, and foals are capable of standing and running within a short time following birth. Foals are usually born in the spring.",
    "Horses, particularly colts, are sometimes physically capable of reproduction at about 18 months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed before the age of three, especially females. Horses four years old are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six; maturation also depends on the horse's size, breed, sex, and quality of care."

    "Although the pursuit of cost estimate accuracy should always be encouraged, a study in 2002 found that the estimates used to determine whether important infrastructure should be built were \"highly and systematically misleading.\".",
    "Generally more contingency is needed for earlier estimates due to the higher uncertainty of estimate accuracy.18.",
    "The method used for most definitive estimates is to fully define and understand the scope, take off or quantify the scope, and apply costing to the scope, which can then be summed to a total cost.",
    "Early estimates may employ various means of cost modeling.",
    "The basic characteristics of effective estimating include: clear identification of task, broad participation in preparing estimates, availability of valid data, standardized structure for the estimate, provision for program uncertainties, recognition of inflation, recognition of excluded costs, independent review of estimates, and revision of estimates for significant program changes. Application of best practices helps ensure a high-quality estimate.",
    "“Certain best practices should be followed if accurate and credible cost estimates are to be developed.",
    "These best practices represent an overall process of established, repeatable methods that result in high-quality cost estimates that are comprehensive and accurate and that can be easily and clearly traced, replicated, and updated.”.",
    "Estimates for the cost of facility construction are a major part of the cost estimate domain.",
    "A construction general contractor or subcontractor must normally prepare definitive cost estimates to prepare bids in the construction bidding process to compete for award of the contract.",
    "Earlier estimates are prepared by differing methods by estimators and others to support the planning process and to compare with bids.",
    "One way to make those estimates is by determining the resources needed  and then multiplying the estimated construction material quantities by the corresponding unit cost.",
    "One advantage of making estimates in this way is that it allows for the segregation of quantities and costs.",
    "Various techniques are employed for these estimates, including experience and judgment, historical values and charts, rules of thumb, and simple mathematical calculations. Factor estimating is one of the more popular methods."

The causes of mortality and morbidity include heart disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes and cancer, specifically, breast, endometrial, colorectal, lung, and epithelial ovarian cancer. The link between heart disease and diabetes mortality and sitting is well-established, but the risk of cancer mortality is unclear.

The terms \"Indian subcontinent\" and \"South Asia\" are often used interchangeably to denote the region, although the geopolitical term of South Asia frequently includes Afghanistan, which may otherwise be classified as Central Asian..",
    "Geologically, the Indian subcontinent originates from Insular India, an isolated landmass that rifted from the supercontinent of Gondwana during the Cretaceous and merged with the landmass of Eurasia nearly 55 million years ago, forming the Himalayas. Historically, as well as to the present day, it is and has been the most populated region in the world, holding roughly 20–25 percent of the global population at all times in history.",
    "Geographically, it is the peninsular region in South Asia, delineated by the Himalayas in the north, the Hindu Kush in the west, and the Arakan in the east. The neighboring geographical regions around the subcontinent include the Tibetan Plateau to the north, the Indochinese Peninsula to the east, and the Iranian Plateau to the west and the Indian Ocean to the south.",
    "According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term subcontinent signifies a \"subdivision of a continent which has a distinct geographical, political, or cultural identity\" and also a \"large land mass somewhat smaller than a continent\". Its use to signify the Indian subcontinent is evidenced from the early twentieth century when most of the territory was part of British Empire, as it was a convenient term to refer to the region comprising both British India and the princely states under British Paramountcy..",
    "Indian subcontinent as a term has been particularly common in the British Empire and its successors, while the term South Asia is the more common usage in Europe and North America. According to historians Sugata Bose and Ayesha Jalal, the Indian subcontinent has come to be known as South Asia \"in more recent and neutral parlance\". Indologist Ronald B.",
    "Inden argues that the usage of the term South Asia is becoming more widespread since it clearly distinguishes the region from East Asia. While South Asia, a more accurate term that reflects the region's contemporary political demarcations, is replacing the Indian subcontinent, a term closely linked to the region's colonial heritage, as a cover term, the latter is still widely used in typological studies..",
    "Since the partition of India, citizens of Pakistan  and Bangladesh  often perceive the use of the Indian subcontinent as offensive and suspicious because of the dominant placement of India in the term.",
    "As such it is being increasingly less used in those countries. Meanwhile, many Indian analysts prefer to use the term because of the socio-cultural commonalities of the region. The region has also been called the \"Asian subcontinent\", the \"South Asian subcontinent\", as well as \"India\" or \"Greater India\" in the classical and pre-modern sense..",
    "The Indian subcontinent was formerly part of Gondwana, a supercontinent formed during the late Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic. Gondwana began to break up during the Mesozoic, with Insular India separating from Antarctica 130-120 million years ago and Madagascar around 90 million years ago. during the Cretaceous.",
    "Insular India subsequently drifted northeastwards, colliding with the Eurasian Plate nearly 55 million years ago, during the Eocene, forming the Indian subcontinent. The zone where the Eurasian and Indian subcontinent plates meet remains geologically active, prone to major earthquakes..",
    "Physiographically, it is a peninsular region in South Asia delineated by the Himalayas in the north, the Hindu Kush in the west, and the Arakanese in the east. It extends southward into the Indian Ocean with the Arabian Sea to the southwest and the Bay of Bengal to the southeast. Most of this region rests on the Indian Plate and is isolated from the rest of Asia by large mountain barriers. Laccadive Islands, Maldives and the Chagos Archipelago are three series of coral atolls, cays and Faroes on the Indian plate along with the Chagos–Laccadive Ridge, a submarine ridge that was generated by the northern drift of the Indian Plate over the Réunion hotspot during the Cretaceous and early Cenozoic times. The Maldives archipelago rises from a basement of volcanic basalt outpourings from a depth of about 2000 m forming the central part of the ridge between Laccadives and the Great Chagos Bank..",

    "This natural physical landmass in South Asia is the dry-land portion of the Indian Plate, which has been relatively isolated from the rest of Eurasia. The Himalayas , Karakoram  and the Hindu Kush mountains  form its northern boundary. In the west it is bounded by parts of the mountain ranges of Hindu Kush, Spīn Ghar , Sulaiman Mountains, Kirthar Mountains, Brahui range, and Pab range among others, with the Western Fold Belt along the border  is the western boundary of the Indian Plate, where, along the Eastern Hindu Kush, lies the Afghanistan–Pakistan border. In the east, it is bounded by Patkai, Naga, Lushai and Chin hills. The Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea forms the boundary of the Indian subcontinent in the south, south-east and south-west..",
    "Given the difficulty of passage through the Himalayas, the sociocultural, religious and political interaction of the Indian subcontinent has largely been through the valleys of Afghanistan in its northwest, the valleys of Manipur in its east, and by maritime routes. More difficult but historically important interaction has also occurred through passages pioneered by the Tibetans.",
    "These routes and interactions have led to the spread of Buddhism out of the Indian subcontinent into other parts of Asia.",
    "And the Islamic expansion arrived into the Indian subcontinent in two ways, through Afghanistan on land and to the Indian coast through the maritime routes on the Arabian Sea..",
    "In terms of modern geopolitical boundaries, the Indian subcontinent constitutes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Pakistan, besides, by convention, the island country of Sri Lanka and other nearby island nations of the Indian Ocean, such as Maldives and the British Indian Ocean Territory, unlike \"South Asia\" sometimes the expression \"Indian subcontinent\" may exclude the islands of Maldives and Sri Lanka. According to Chris Brewster and Wolfgang Mayrhofer, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan constitute the Indian subcontinent.",
    "Brewster and Mayrhofer also maintain that with Afghanistan and Maldives included the region is referred to as South Asia. The periphery of the subcontinent, including Pakistan, Bangladesh and the island chains of the Maldives, features large Muslim populations, while the heartland, including most of India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, are overwhelmingly Hindu or Buddhist. Since most of these countries are located on the Indian Plate, a continuous landmass, the borders between countries are often either a river or a no man's land..",
    "The precise definition of an \"Indian subcontinent\" in a geopolitical context is somewhat contested as there is no globally accepted definition on which countries are a part of South Asia or the Indian subcontinent. Whether called the Indian subcontinent or South Asia, the definition of the geographical extent of this region varies. Afghanistan, despite often considered as a part of South Asia, is usually not included in the Indian subcontinent. Maldives, an island country consisting of a small archipelago southwest of the peninsula, while largely considered a part of the Indian subcontinent, sometimes is mentioned by sources, including the International Monetary Fund, as a group of islands away from the Indian subcontinent in a south-western direction..",

    "Geopolitically, it includes the countries of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. The terms \"Indian subcontinent\" and \"South Asia\" are often used interchangeably to denote the region, although the geopolitical term of South Asia frequently includes Afghanistan, which may otherwise be classified as Central Asian..",
    "Geologically, the Indian subcontinent originates from Insular India, an isolated landmass that rifted from the supercontinent of Gondwana during the Cretaceous and merged with the landmass of Eurasia nearly 55 million years ago, forming the Himalayas. Historically, as well as to the present day, it is and has been the most populated region in the world, holding roughly 20–25 percent of the global population at all times in history.",
    "Geographically, it is the peninsular region in South Asia, delineated by the Himalayas in the north, the Hindu Kush in the west, and the Arakan in the east. The neighboring geographical regions around the subcontinent include the Tibetan Plateau to the north, the Indochinese Peninsula to the east, and the Iranian Plateau to the west and the Indian Ocean to the south.",
    "According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term subcontinent signifies a \"subdivision of a continent which has a distinct geographical, political, or cultural identity\" and also a \"large land mass somewhat smaller than a continent\". Its use to signify the Indian subcontinent is evidenced from the early twentieth century when most of the territory was part of British Empire, as it was a convenient term to refer to the region comprising both British India and the princely states under British Paramountcy..",
    "Indian subcontinent as a term has been particularly common in the British Empire and its successors, while the term South Asia is the more common usage in Europe and North America. According to historians Sugata Bose and Ayesha Jalal, the Indian subcontinent has come to be known as South Asia \"in more recent and neutral parlance\". Indologist Ronald B.",
    "Inden argues that the usage of the term South Asia is becoming more widespread since it clearly distinguishes the region from East Asia. While South Asia, a more accurate term that reflects the region's contemporary political demarcations, is replacing the Indian subcontinent, a term closely linked to the region's colonial heritage, as a cover term, the latter is still widely used in typological studies..",
    "Since the partition of India, citizens of Pakistan  and Bangladesh  often perceive the use of the Indian subcontinent as offensive and suspicious because of the dominant placement of India in the term."

By the fifth season, the series transitioned to Maya. The studio now runs a 120-processor render farm that can produce 30 or more shots per hour. The animation of South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut is therefore seen as an example of how South Park's visual quality has improved in recent seasons.

IGN described the animation as \"fall somewhere within the middle ground—not quite cardboard cutouts, but not quite fully computerized either.\" Nate Boss, in a review for High-Def Digest, commented, \"There is no comparing the two, as the movie has a classic  animated feel, so full of the cut-outs we have grown to love, while the newer seasons sport a more computer processed feel.\" The film, compared to the series at the time of its production, was animated in widescreen . \"Although the 'primitive' animation of South Park is supposedly a joke, it's really a secret weapon,\" wrote Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.",

IGN's Scott Lowe explained, \"Although clearly aged, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut looks great and is free of the washed out, compressed imperfections of previous standard definition releases of the film.\" However, Michael Zupan of DVDTalk notes that an automatic digital scratch removal process may have inadvertently removed some intentional lines from the picture, notably during Cartman's first scene with the V-chip.

According to the Iranian mythology, the country's name comes from the name of Iraj, a legendary prince and shah who was killed by his brothers. Historically, Iran has been referred to as Persia by the West, due mainly to the writings of Greek historians who referred to all of Iran as Persís , meaning \"land of the Persians\", while Persis itself was one of the provinces of ancient Iran that is today known as Fars.

    "On July 14, as the three have agreed, Danny plays Striking Vipers X with Karl while Theo goes to the bar without her wedding ring to meet a stranger.",
    "Although previous series of the programme produced under Netflix contained six episodes, series five comprises three episodes, as the series creator Charlie Brooker viewed this as preferable to making viewers wait longer for the next series. The three episodes—\"Striking Vipers\", \"Smithereens\" and \"Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too\"—were released on Netflix simultaneously on 5 June 2019. As Black Mirror is an anthology series, each instalment can be watched in any order. \"Striking Vipers\" was filmed before Bandersnatch..",
    "The idea was conceived for two of the employees to have an affair within the simulation. This story changed over time, and was informed by another source of inspiration: Brooker was reflecting on his days of playing the fighting game Tekken with flatmates in the 1990s, and thought there was something interesting in the \"homoerotic\" and \"weirdly primal\" nature of the situation. He thought that neighbours could confuse their gaming sessions for a sex dungeon based on the noises they made. During the writing of \"Striking Vipers\", a variety of fighting games were used for reference, including Dead or Alive, a series where the characters have sexually provocative appearances..",
    "Jones said the episode relates to the question of \"when porn stops being a healthy distraction and actually becomes an affair\". The name \"Striking Vipers\", which alludes to snakes and perhaps sexual imagery, was chosen by Brooker to sound like a plausible game title. During the writing process, he nicknamed it \"Man Junipero\", in reference to the series three episode \"San Junipero\". Brooker was conflicted as to whether the relationship between Danny and Karl is accurately described as a gay relationship, saying that it is also about male friendship and the barriers to communication between men. Jones noted that Danny's character regains a younger physique by entering the game, saying that there was a broader theme about ageing and \"finding your identity when you don't have those staples that you've grown up with\"..",
    "\"Striking Vipers\" was the third Black Mirror episode to be directed by Owen Harris, after series two's \"Be Right Back\", and series three's \"San Junipero\". The episode has an all-black main cast, with Anthony Mackie as Danny, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Karl and Nicole Beharie as Theo. Beharie was a big fan of the show prior to her appearance. Within Striking Vipers X, Danny plays as Lance—portrayed by Ludi Lin—and Karl plays as Roxie—acted by Pom Klementieff.",
    "For example, the final scene of the episode shows a Striking Vipers X scene on top of a skyscraper, shot near the Edifício Copan, with a former Hilton Hotel made to look disused with computer-generated imagery..",
    "Jones said of Danny and Karl's real-life kiss that both actors aimed to be clear that the excitement from Striking Vipers X was \"not being echoed in the real world\", and that the characters were relieved by this. Abdul-Mateen thought the scene was important in its depiction of two black men with \"a vessel to explore their sexuality and to understand who they are\". Describing the filming, he said that \"shooting in the rain is never easy\" and estimated it took three to four hours. Harris saw the ending as \"pragmatic\": they considered showing more details about whether the arrangement was succeeding in practice, but chose to leave the ambiguity. Abdul-Mateen noted that Karl has a cat at the end of the episode, which means \"he has something to take care of\".",
    "The episode is a romance, where Danny, Karl and Theo are in a love triangle. Dan Stubbs of NME and Jim Vorel of Paste characterised it as a \"spiritual sequel\" to \"San Junipero\". Stubbs saw that as in \"San Junipero\", the episode \"finds the beauty and ugliness in a new form of romance\". Writing for Vox, Alex Abad-Santos compared that in \"San Junipero\", Kelly and Yorkie \"play semi-artificial, digital-only versions of themselves\", like Danny and Karl. Stubbs and Wired's Matt Reynolds found that in \"Striking Vipers\", the technology is not the focus of the episode—instead its implications and the human stories are. Zack Handlen of The A.V.",
    "He also suggested that a \"virtual/real life balance\" could be as fundamental as a work–life balance. Hugh Montgomery, writing for the BBC, found a \"pornographic quality of computer game violence\" and Abad-Santos saw \"Striking Vipers\" as serving to connect \"video game addiction and porn addiction\" as well as \"violence and men's sexuality\". Another perspective came from Bojalad, who wrote that the episode sees video games as \"a safe, consequence-free simulation space for little boys and eventually little men to work though the complex feelings they've so often ignored\". Ahr similarly described that Striking Vipers X lets the characters \"shed their culturally ingrained male inhibitions and admit their devotion to each other in a way that society discourages in real life\"..",
    "Bojalad and Ahr both commented that Theo is aroused by Danny treating her like a stranger, a sign of her later desires to meet strangers at a bar. Reynolds interpreted that the roleplay \"sets up this idea that the desire to be someone a little different is a completely human thing\". Additionally, Karl's mock-humping of Danny while playing Striking Vipers was seen by Bramesco to indicate homoerotic tension. Ahr stated that early on, Theo tells Danny he should talk \"more openly and frequently\" to Karl, and communication between them is a central tension in the episode. The episode also makes reference to other Black Mirror instalments: it shows products made by SaitoGemu, of \"Playtest\", and TCKR, of \"San Junipero\"; and Karl's pinball machine has different gameplay modes that can be seen to reference locations from past episodes..",
    "Power criticised the occurrence of virtual reality \"as a plot device\" as overused in Black Mirror. While Vorel saw Danny and Karl's reactions to be \"profoundly well-earned\", and Bojalad saw their sex scenes as \"surprisingly raw and powerful\", Bramesco did not see a \"foundation of desire\" leading to the first kiss. Vorel and Robinson wanted further information about how or why people are using Striking Vipers X as a sex simulator, or why it was designed to have this functionality. Contrastingly, Stubbs opined that the initial in-game scenes were \"incredibly funny\" and the rest were \"brilliant\". Turk criticised Roxette's description of sex as \"the full orchestra\" for women to be \"awful\" and \"corny\", and Bramesco and the Digital Spy critics Ali Griffiths and Morgan Jeffery disliked Lance's \"don't feel like a gay thing\" line. Sims said that the ending was \"odd\" and \"slightly melancholy\". Turk thought Danny, Karl and Theo's once-a-year arrangement is a dated solution because it maintains Danny and Theo's \"traditional hetero monogamous marriage with two kids and an annual family barbecue\", rather than meaningfully integrating any change into it. Similarly, Bramesco thought that the supposedly happy ending works by \"gracefully eliding\" every day of the year but one..",
    "Comparisons to \"San Junipero\" based on quality were largely unfavourable, such as that of The Guardian's Guy Lodge, who saw \"Striking Vipers\" as \"hollow by comparison\". Reynolds thought that the episode's themes were \"explored in a more gripping way\" in \"San Junipero\". Similarly, Bramesco reviewed the episode as a \"dunderheaded thought experiment\" which was like \"San Junipero\" but where \"everything that could have gone wrong ..",
    "does so\". Sims found it \"nervier\" and \"less swooning\" than the other romance episodes, lacking the \"rebellious fun\" of \"San Junipero\" but also the \"tragic tinge\" of \"Be Right Back\" and \"Hang the DJ\". Similarly, Power critiqued that \"San Junipero\" and \"Hang the DJ\" had \"something genuinely profound\" to say about love, but \"Striking Vipers\" does not.",
    "As such, only the former two episodes \"earned\" their happy ending. Griffiths and Jeffery criticised that \"queerness is always neatly hidden away in virtual worlds\" in Black Mirror, both in \"San Junipero\" and \"Striking Vipers\".",
    "They stated that \"Striking Vipers\" did not address its themes deeply enough, such as by not showing on-screen the conversation Danny has where he confesses the situation to Theo. However, Montgomery dissented, writing that \"Striking Vipers\" was similar to \"Be Right Back\" and \"San Junipero\" as three of \"the finest and most soulful\" episodes..",
    "\"Striking Vipers\" ranked as follows on critics' lists of the 23 instalments of Black Mirror, from best to worst:.",

    "The value is nonetheless usable because it is derived from the best information available. Typically, estimation involves \"using the value of a statistic derived from a sample to estimate the value of a corresponding population parameter\". The sample provides information that can be projected, through various formal or informal processes, to determine a range most likely to describe the missing information.",

    "Because the distribution of candies inside the jar may vary, the observer can count the number of candies visible through the glass, consider the size of the jar, and presume that a similar distribution can be found in the parts that can not be seen, thereby making an estimate of the total number of candies that could be in the jar if that presumption were true.",
    "Estimates can similarly be generated by projecting results from polls or surveys onto the entire population.",
    "In making an estimate, the goal is often most useful to generate a range of possible outcomes that is precise enough to be useful but not so precise that it is likely to be inaccurate. For example, in trying to guess the number of candies in the jar, if fifty were visible, and the total volume of the jar seemed to be about twenty times as large as the volume containing the visible candies, then one might simply project that there were a thousand candies in the jar.",
    "Such a projection, intended to pick the single value that is believed to be closest to the actual value, is called a point estimate. However, a point estimation is likely to be incorrect, because the sample size—in this case, the number of candies that are visible—is too small a number to be sure that it does not contain anomalies that differ from the population as a whole. A corresponding concept is an interval estimate, which captures a much larger range of possibilities, but is too broad to be useful. For example, if one were asked to estimate the percentage of people who like candy, it would clearly be correct that the number falls between zero and one hundred percent. Such an estimate would provide no guidance, however, to somebody who is trying to determine how many candies to buy for a party to be attended by a hundred people.",

    "Estimates can similarly be generated by projecting results from polls or surveys onto the entire population.",
    "In making an estimate, the goal is often most useful to generate a range of possible outcomes that is precise enough to be useful but not so precise that it is likely to be inaccurate. For example, in trying to guess the number of candies in the jar, if fifty were visible, and the total volume of the jar seemed to be about twenty times as large as the volume containing the visible candies, then one might simply project that there were a thousand candies in the jar.",
    "Such a projection, intended to pick the single value that is believed to be closest to the actual value, is called a point estimate. However, a point estimation is likely to be incorrect, because the sample size—in this case, the number of candies that are visible—is too small a number to be sure that it does not contain anomalies that differ from the population as a whole. A corresponding concept is an interval estimate, which captures a much larger range of possibilities, but is too broad to be useful. For example, if one were asked to estimate the percentage of people who like candy, it would clearly be correct that the number falls between zero and one hundred percent. Such an estimate would provide no guidance, however, to somebody who is trying to determine how many candies to buy for a party to be attended by a hundred people.",

    "The value is nonetheless usable because it is derived from the best information available.

    "The longest Polish river is the Vistula, and Poland's highest point is Mount Rysy, situated in the Tatra mountain range of the Carpathians.",
    "Culturally diverse throughout late antiquity, the region became inhabited by tribal Polans who gave Poland its name in the early medieval period.",
    "The Kingdom of Poland emerged in 1025 and in 1569 cemented its longstanding association with Lithuania, thus forming the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.",
    "In September 1939, the German-Soviet invasion of Poland marked the beginning of World War II, which resulted in the Holocaust and millions of Polish casualties.",
    "Through the emergence and contributions of the Solidarity movement, the communist government was dissolved and Poland re-established itself as a democratic state in 1989.",
    "Poland is a parliamentary republic, with its bicameral legislature comprising the Sejm and the Senate.",
    "Considered a middle power, Poland has the sixth largest economy in the European Union by GDP  and the fifth largest by GDP .",
    "Poland is a founding member state of the United Nations, as well as a member of the World Trade Organization, NATO, and the European Union .",
    "The native Polish name for Poland is Polska. The name is derived from the Polans, a West Slavic tribe who inhabited the Warta River basin of present-day Greater Poland region . The tribe's name stems from the Proto-Slavic noun pole meaning field, which in-itself originates from the Proto-Indo-European word *pleh₂- indicating flatland. The etymology alludes to the topography of the region and the flat landscape of Greater Poland. The English name Poland was formed in the 1560s, from German Pole and the suffix -land, denoting a people or nation. Prior to its adoption, the Latin form Polonia was widely used throughout medieval Europe..",
    "The country's alternative archaic name is Lechia and its root syllable remains in official use in several languages, notably Hungarian, Lithuanian, and Persian. The exonym possibly derives from either Lech, a legendary ruler of the Lechites, or from the Lendians, a West Slavic tribe that dwelt on the south-easternmost edge of present-day Lesser Poland region. The origin of the tribe's name lies in the Old Polish word lęda . Initially, both names Lechia and Polonia were used interchangeably when referring to Poland by chroniclers during the Middle Ages..",
    "The first Stone Age archaic humans and Homo erectus species settled what was to become Poland approximately 500,000 years ago, though the ensuing hostile climate prevented early humans from founding more permanent encampments. The arrival of Homo sapiens and anatomically modern humans coincided with the climatic discontinuity at the end of the Last Glacial Period , when Poland became habitable. Neolithic excavations indicated broad-ranging development in that era; the earliest evidence of European cheesemaking  was discovered in Polish Kuyavia, and the Bronocice pot is incised with the earliest known depiction of what may be a wheeled vehicle ..",
    "The period spanning the Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age  was marked by an increase in population density, establishment of palisaded settlements  and the expansion of Lusatian culture. A significant archaeological find from the protohistory of Poland is a fortified settlement at Biskupin, attributed to the Lusatian culture of the Late Bronze Age ..",
    "Throughout antiquity , many distinct ancient populations inhabited the territory of present-day Poland, notably Celtic, Scythian, Germanic, Sarmatian, Baltic and Slavic tribes. Furthermore, archaeological findings confirmed the presence of Roman Legions sent to protect the amber trade. The Polish tribes emerged following the second wave of the Migration Period around the 6th century AD; they were Slavic and possibly may have included assimilated remnants of peoples that earlier dwelled in the area. Beginning in the early 10th century, the Polans would come to dominate other Lechitic tribes in the region, initially forming a tribal federation and later a centralised monarchial state..",
    "Poland began to form into a recognisable unitary and territorial entity around the middle of the 10th century under the Piast dynasty. In 966, ruler of the Polans Mieszko I accepted Christianity under the auspices of the Roman Church with the Baptism of Poland. An incipit titled Dagome iudex first defined Poland's geographical boundaries with its capital and bishopric at Gniezno, and affirmed that its monarchy was under the protection of the Apostolic See. The country's early origins were described by Gallus Anonymus in Gesta principum Polonorum, the oldest Polish chronicle. An important national event of the period was the martyrdom of Saint Adalbert, who was killed by Prussian pagans in 997 and whose remains were reputedly bought back for their weight in gold by Mieszko's successor, Bolesław I the Brave..",
    "In 1000, at the Congress of Gniezno, Bolesław obtained the right of investiture from Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor, who assented to the creation of additional bishoprics. Three new dioceses were subsequently established in Kraków, Kołobrzeg, and Wrocław. Also, Otto bestowed upon Bolesław royal regalia and a replica of the Holy Lance, which were later used at his coronation as the first King of Poland in circa 1025, when Bolesław received permission for his coronation from Pope John XIX. Bolesław also expanded the realm considerably by seizing parts of German Lusatia, Czech Moravia, Upper Hungary and southwestern regions of the Kievan Rus'..",
    "The transition from paganism in Poland was not instantaneous and resulted in the pagan reaction of the 1030s. In 1031, Mieszko II Lambert lost the title of king and fled amidst the violence. The unrest led to the transfer of the capital to Kraków in 1038 by Casimir I the Restorer. In 1076, Bolesław II re-instituted the office of king, but was banished in 1079 for murdering his opponent, Bishop Stanislaus. In 1138, the country fragmented into five principalities when Bolesław III Wrymouth divided his lands among his sons. These comprised Lesser Poland, Greater Poland, Silesia, Masovia and Sandomierz, with intermittent hold over Pomerania. In 1226, Konrad I of Masovia invited the Teutonic Knights to aid in combating the Baltic Prussians; a decision that led to centuries of warfare with the Knights..",
    "In the mid-13th century, Henry I the Bearded and Henry II the Pious aimed to unite the fragmented dukedoms, but the Mongol invasions and the death of Henry II in battle hindered the unification. As a result of the devastation which followed, depopulation and the demand for craft labour spurred a migration of German and Flemish settlers into Poland, which was encouraged by the Polish dukes. In 1264, the Statute of Kalisz introduced unprecedented autonomy for the Polish Jews, who came to Poland fleeing persecution elsewhere in Europe. In 1320, Władysław I the Short became the first king of a reunified Poland since Przemysł II in 1296, and the first to be crowned at Wawel Cathedral in Kraków..",
    "Beginning in 1333, the reign of Casimir III the Great was marked by developments in castle infrastructure, army, judiciary and diplomacy. Under his authority, Poland transformed into a major European power; he instituted Polish rule over Ruthenia in 1340 and imposed quarantine that prevented the spread of Black Death. In 1364, Casimir inaugurated the University of Kraków, one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in Europe. Upon his death in 1370, the Piast dynasty came to an end. He was succeeded by his closest male relative, Louis of Anjou, who ruled Poland, Hungary and Croatia in a personal union. Louis' younger daughter Jadwiga became Poland's first female monarch in 1384..",
    "In 1386, Jadwiga of Poland entered a marriage of convenience with Władysław II Jagiełło, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, thus forming the Jagiellonian dynasty and the Polish–Lithuanian union which spanned the late Middle Ages and early Modern Era. The partnership between Poles and Lithuanians brought the vast multi-ethnic Lithuanian territories into Poland's sphere of influence and proved beneficial for its inhabitants, who coexisted in one of the largest European political entities of the time..",
    "In the Baltic Sea region, the struggle of Poland and Lithuania with the Teutonic Knights continued and culminated at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, where a combined Polish-Lithuanian army inflicted a decisive victory against them. In 1466, after the Thirteen Years' War, king Casimir IV Jagiellon gave royal consent to the Peace of Thorn, which created the future Duchy of Prussia under Polish suzerainty and forced the Prussian rulers to pay tributes. The Jagiellonian dynasty also established dynastic control over the kingdoms of Bohemia  and Hungary. In the south, Poland confronted the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Tatars, and in the east helped Lithuania to combat Russia..",
    "Poland was developing as a feudal state, with a predominantly agricultural economy and an increasingly powerful landed nobility that confined the population to private manorial farmsteads, or folwarks. In 1493, John I Albert sanctioned the creation of a bicameral parliament composed of a lower house, the Sejm, and an upper house, the Senate. The Nihil novi act adopted by the Polish General Sejm in 1505, transferred most of the legislative power from the monarch to the parliament, an event which marked the beginning of the period known as Golden Liberty, when the state was ruled by the seemingly free and equal Polish nobles..",
    "The 16th century saw Protestant Reformation movements making deep inroads into Polish Christianity, which resulted in the establishment of policies promoting religious tolerance, unique in Europe at that time. This tolerance allowed the country to avoid the religious turmoil and wars of religion that beset Europe. In Poland, Nontrinitarian Christianity became the doctrine of the so-called Polish Brethren, who separated from their Calvinist denomination and became the co-founders of global Unitarianism..",
    "The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth occupied approximately 1 million km2  at its peak and was the largest state in Europe. Simultaneously, Poland imposed Polonisation policies in newly acquired territories which were met with resistance from ethnic and religious minorities..",
    "In 1573, Henry de Valois of France, the first elected king, approbated the Henrician Articles which obliged future monarchs to respect the rights of nobles. His successor, Stephen Báthory, led a successful campaign in the Livonian War, granting Poland more lands across the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea. State affairs were then headed by Jan Zamoyski, the Crown Chancellor. In 1592, Sigismund III of Poland succeeded his father, John Vasa, in Sweden. The Polish-Swedish union endured until 1599, when he was deposed by the Swedes..",
    "Sigismund's long reign in Poland coincided with the Silver Age. The liberal Władysław IV effectively defended Poland's territorial possessions but after his death the vast Commonwealth began declining from internal disorder and constant warfare. In 1648, the Polish hegemony over Ukraine sparked the Khmelnytsky Uprising, followed by the decimating Swedish Deluge during the Second Northern War, and Prussia's independence in 1657. In 1683, John III Sobieski re-established military prowess when he halted the advance of an Ottoman Army into Europe at the Battle of Vienna. The successive Saxon era, under Augustus II and Augustus III, saw the rise of neighbouring countries in the aftermath of the Great Northern War  and the War of the Polish Succession ..",
    "The royal election of 1764 resulted in the elevation of Stanisław II Augustus Poniatowski to the monarchy. His candidacy was extensively funded by his sponsor and former lover, Empress Catherine II of Russia. The new king maneuvered between his desire to implement necessary modernising reforms, and the necessity to remain at peace with surrounding states. His ideals led to the formation of the 1768 Bar Confederation, a rebellion directed against the Poniatowski and all external influence, which ineptly aimed to preserve Poland's sovereignty and privileges held by the nobility. The failed attempts at government restructuring as well as the domestic turmoil provoked its neighbours to intervene..",
    "On 24 October 1795, the Commonwealth was partitioned for the third time and ceased to exist as a territorial entity. Stanisław Augustus, the last King of Poland, abdicated the throne on 25 November 1795.."

    "Pigs, especially miniature breeds, are kept as pets.",
    "The pig typically has a large head, with a long snout which is strengthened by a special prenasal bone and a disk of cartilage at the tip. The snout is used to dig into the soil to find food and is a very acute sense organ.",
    "The dental formula of adult pigs is\n3.1.4.3\n3.1.4.3\n, giving a total of 44 teeth.",
    "Most pigs have rather a bristled sparse hair covering on their skin, although woolly-coated breeds such as the Mangalitsa exist..",
    "Pigs possess both apocrine and eccrine sweat glands, although the latter appear limited to the snout and dorsonasal areas. Pigs, however, like other \"hairless\" mammals (e.g.",
    "elephants, rhinos, and mole-rats), do not use thermal sweat glands in cooling. Pigs are also less able than many other mammals to dissipate heat from wet mucous membranes in the mouth through panting.",
    "Their thermoneutral zone is 16 to 22 °C . At higher temperatures, pigs lose heat by wallowing in mud or water via evaporative cooling, although it has been suggested that wallowing may serve other functions, such as protection from sunburn, ecto-parasite control, and scent-marking..",
    "Pigs are one of four known mammalian species which possess mutations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that protect against snake venom.",
    "Mongooses, honey badgers, hedgehogs, and pigs all have modifications to the receptor pocket which prevents the snake venom α-neurotoxin from binding.",
    "Pigs have small lungs in relation to their body size, and are thus more susceptible than other domesticated animals to fatal bronchitis and pneumonia. Pigs have a maximum life span of about 27 years..",
    "The genome of the pig has been sequenced and contains about 22,342 protein-coding genes..",
    "The pig is most often considered to be a subspecies of the wild boar, which was given the name Sus scrofa by Carl Linnaeus in 1758; following from this, the formal name of the pig is Sus scrofa domesticus. However, in 1777, Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben classified the pig as a separate species from the wild boar.",
    "Archaeological evidence suggests that pigs were domesticated from wild boar in the Near East in the Tigris Basin, Çayönü, Cafer Höyük, Nevalı Çori being managed in the wild in a way similar to the way they are managed by some modern New Guineans. Remains of pigs have been dated to earlier than 11,400 years ago in Cyprus.",
    "Those animals must have been introduced from the mainland, which suggests domestication in the adjacent mainland by then. Pigs were separately domesticated in China beginning 8,000 years ago, and have been one of the most important domesticated animal there ever since..",
    "In the Near East, pig husbandry spread for the next few millennia.",
    "DNA evidence from subfossil remains of teeth and jawbones of Neolithic pigs shows that the first domestic pigs in Europe had been brought from the Near East.",
    "This stimulated the domestication of local European wild boar, resulting in a third domestication event with the Near Eastern genes dying out in European pig stock.",
    "Modern domesticated pigs have involved complex exchanges, with European domesticated lines being exported, in turn, to the ancient Near East. Historical records indicate that Asian pigs were introduced into Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries..",
    "In August 2015, a study looked at over 100 pig genome sequences to ascertain their process of domestication, which was assumed to have been initiated by humans, involved few individuals, and relied on reproductive isolation between wild and domestic forms.",
    "The study indicated that pigs were domesticated separately in Western Asia and China, with Western Asian pigs introduced into Europe, where they crossed with wild boar.",
    "A model that fit the data included a mixture with a now extinct ghost population of wild pigs during the Pleistocene.",
    "The study also found that despite back-crossing with wild pigs, the genomes of domestic pigs have strong signatures of selection at DNA loci that affect behavior and morphology.",

    "In the following examples, certain influences may appear to travel faster than light, but they do not convey energy or information faster than light, so they do not violate special relativity.",
    "If a laser beam is swept across a distant object, the spot of laser light can easily be made to move across the object at a speed greater than c. Similarly, a shadow projected onto a distant object can be made to move across the object faster than c. In neither case does the light travel from the source to the object faster than c, nor does any information travel faster than light..",
    "Since one might not travel faster than light, one might conclude that a human can never travel further from the Earth than 40 light-years if the traveler is active between the age of 20 and 60.",

However, it was shown in 2011 that a single photon may not travel faster than c. In quantum mechanics, virtual particles may travel faster than light, and this phenomenon is related to the fact that static field effects  may travel faster than light .",

The leaves are evergreen, alternate, simple, 15–35 centimetres  long, and 6–16 cm  broad; when the leaves are young they are orange-pink, rapidly changing to a dark, glossy red, then dark green as they mature. The flowers are produced in terminal panicles 10–40 cm  long; each flower is small and white with five petals 5–10 millimetres  long, with a mild, sweet fragrance. Over 500 varieties of mangoes are known, many of which ripen in summer, while some give a double crop. The fruit takes four to five months from flowering to ripening..",

However, blocking arbitrarily large groups of symbols is impractical, as the complexity of a Huffman code is linear in the number of possibilities to be encoded, a number that is exponential in the size of a block.",
    "A practical alternative, in widespread use, is run-length encoding.",
    "This technique adds one step in advance of entropy coding, specifically counting  of repeated symbols, which are then encoded.",
    "For the simple case of Bernoulli processes, Golomb coding is optimal among prefix codes for coding run length, a fact proved via the techniques of Huffman coding. A similar approach is taken by fax machines using modified Huffman coding.",
    "However, run-length coding is not as adaptable to as many input types as other compression technologies.",
    "Many variations of Huffman coding exist, some of which use a Huffman-like algorithm, and others of which find optimal prefix codes ."

    "Among theories advanced to account for the reddish sky in the background is the artist's memory of the effects of the powerful volcanic eruption of Krakatoa, which deeply tinted sunset skies red in parts of the Western hemisphere for months during 1883 and 1884, about a decade before Munch painted The Scream. This explanation has been disputed by scholars, who note that Munch was an expressive painter and was not primarily interested in literal renderings of what he had seen.",
    "Another explanation for the red skies is that they are due to the appearance of nacreous clouds which occur at the latitude of Norway and which look remarkably similar to the skies depicted in The Scream. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the proximity of both a slaughterhouse and a lunatic asylum to the site depicted in the painting may have offered some inspiration. The scene was identified as being the view from a road overlooking Oslo, by the Oslofjord and Hovedøya, from the hill of Ekeberg. At the time of painting the work, Munch's manic depressive sister Laura Catherine was a patient at the mental asylum at the foot of Ekeberg..",
    "In 1978, the Munch scholar Robert Rosenblum suggested that the strange, skeletal creature in the foreground of the painting was inspired by a Peruvian mummy, which Munch could have seen at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. This mummy, which was buried in a fetal position with its hands alongside its face, also struck the imagination of Paul Gauguin: it stood as a model for figures in more than twenty of Gauguin's paintings, among those the central figure in his painting Human misery  and for the old woman at the left in his painting Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?. In 2004, Piero Mannucci, an Italian anthropologist speculated that Munch might have seen a mummy in Florence's Museum of Natural History, which bears an even more striking resemblance to the painting. However, later studies have disputed the Italian theory, as Munch did not visit Florence until after painting The Scream..",

The painting had been moved down to a second-story gallery as part of the Olympic festivities. After the gallery refused to pay a ransom demand of US$1 million in March 1994, Norwegian police set up a sting operation with assistance from the British police  and the Getty Museum and the painting was recovered undamaged on 7 May 1994. In January 1996, four men were convicted in connection with the theft, including Pål Enger, who had been convicted of stealing Munch's Vampire in 1988. They were released on appeal on legal grounds: the British agents involved in the sting operation had entered Norway under false identities..",

Before repairs and restoration began, the paintings were put on public display by the Munch Museum beginning 27 September 2006.",

    "This series is called the generating function of the sequence.",
    "Unlike an ordinary series, the formal power series is not required to converge: in fact, the generating function is not actually regarded as a function, and the \"variable\" remains an indeterminate.",
    "Generating functions were first introduced by Abraham de Moivre in 1730, in order to solve the general linear recurrence problem. One can generalize to formal power series in more than one indeterminate, to encode information about infinite multi-dimensional arrays of numbers.",
    "There are various types of generating functions, including ordinary generating functions, exponential generating functions, Lambert series, Bell series, and Dirichlet series; definitions and examples are given below.",
    "Every sequence in principle has a generating function of each type , but the ease with which they can be handled may differ considerably.",
    "The particular generating function, if any, that is most useful in a given context will depend upon the nature of the sequence and the details of the problem being addressed.",
    "Generating functions are often expressed in closed form , by some expression involving operations defined for formal series.",
    "These expressions in terms of the indeterminate x may involve arithmetic operations, differentiation with respect to x and composition with  other generating functions; since these operations are also defined for functions, the result looks like a function of x.",
    "Indeed, the closed form expression can often be interpreted as a function that can be evaluated at  concrete values of x, and which has the formal series as its series expansion; this explains the designation \"generating functions\".",
    "Generating functions are not functions in the formal sense of a mapping from a domain to a codomain.",

The Swedish colonisation of the coastal areas of Finland also started during the 12th and 13th century. In the 14th century, the colonisation began to be more organised, and by the end of the century, several of the coastal areas of Finland were inhabited mostly by Swedes..",
    "Except for the provinces of Scania, Blekinge and Halland in the south-west of the Scandinavian peninsula, which were parts of the Kingdom of Denmark during this time, feudalism never developed in Sweden as it did in the rest of Europe. As a result, the peasantry remained largely a class of free farmers throughout most of Swedish history.",

    "There is no evidence for gene flow between the two lineages, indicating that they did not share the same geographic area. The Eurasian and American cave lions became extinct at the end of the last glacial period without mitochondrial descendants on other continents. The modern lion was probably widely distributed in Africa during the Middle Pleistocene and started to diverge in sub-Saharan Africa during the Late Pleistocene.",

They shared a common ancestor probably between 98,000 and 52,000 years ago. Due to the expansion of the Sahara between 83,100 and 26,600 years ago, lion populations in West and North Africa became separated.",

    "A machine is a physical system using power to apply forces and control movement to perform an action.",
    "The term is commonly applied to artificial devices, such as those employing engines or motors, but also to natural biological macromolecules, such as molecular machines.",
    "Machines can be driven by animals and people, by natural forces such as wind and water, and by chemical, thermal, or electrical power, and include a system of mechanisms that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement.",
    "Renaissance natural philosophers identified six simple machines which were the elementary devices that put a load into motion, and calculated the ratio of output force to input force, known today as mechanical advantage..",
    "Modern machines are complex systems that consist of structural elements, mechanisms and control components and include interfaces for convenient use.",
    "Examples include: a wide range of vehicles, such as trains, automobiles, boats and airplanes; appliances in the home and office, including computers, building air handling and water handling systems; as well as farm machinery, machine tools and factory automation systems and robots.",
    "The English word machine comes through Middle French from Latin machina, which in turn derives from the Greek . The word mechanical  comes from the same Greek roots.",
    "In the 17th century, the word machine could also mean a scheme or plot, a meaning now expressed by the derived machination.",
    "The hand axe is the first example of a wedge, the oldest of the six classic simple machines, from which most machines are based.",
    "The second oldest simple machine was the inclined plane , which has been used since prehistoric times to move heavy objects..",
    "The other four simple machines were invented in the ancient Near East. The wheel, along with the wheel and axle mechanism, was invented in Mesopotamia  during the 5th millennium BC. The lever mechanism first appeared around 5,000 years ago in the Near East, where it was used in a simple balance scale, and to move large objects in ancient Egyptian technology. The lever was also used in the shadoof water-lifting device, the first crane machine, which appeared in Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC, and then in ancient Egyptian technology circa 2000 BC. The earliest evidence of pulleys date back to Mesopotamia in the early 2nd millennium BC, and ancient Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty . The screw, the last of the simple machines to be invented, first appeared in Mesopotamia during the Neo-Assyrian period  BC. The Egyptian pyramids were built using three of the six simple machines, the inclined plane, the wedge, and the lever..",
    "Three of the simple machines were studied and described by Greek philosopher Archimedes around the 3rd century BC: the lever, pulley and screw. Archimedes discovered the principle of mechanical advantage in the lever. Later Greek philosophers defined the classic five simple machines  and were able to roughly calculate their mechanical advantage. Heron of Alexandria (ca.",
    "The earliest practical water-powered machines, the water wheel and watermill, first appeared in the Persian Empire, in what are now Iraq and Iran, by the early 4th century BC. The earliest practical wind-powered machines, the windmill and wind pump, first appeared in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age, in what are now Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, by the 9th century AD. The earliest practical steam-powered machine was a steam jack driven by a steam turbine, described in 1551 by Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf in Ottoman Egypt..",
    "The spinning wheel was also a precursor to the spinning jenny, which was a key development during the early Industrial Revolution in the 18th century. The crankshaft and camshaft were invented by Al-Jazari in Northern Mesopotamia circa 1206, and they later became central to modern machinery such as the steam engine, internal combustion engine and automatic controls..",

    "During the Renaissance, the dynamics of the Mechanical Powers, as the simple machines were called, began to be studied from the standpoint of how much useful work they could perform, leading eventually to the new concept of mechanical work.",
    "In 1586 Flemish engineer Simon Stevin derived the mechanical advantage of the inclined plane, and it was included with the other simple machines.",
    "The complete dynamic theory of simple machines was worked out by Italian scientist Galileo Galilei in 1600 in Le Meccaniche . He was the first to understand that simple machines do not create energy, they merely transform it..",
    "The classic rules of sliding friction in machines were discovered by Leonardo da Vinci , but remained unpublished in his notebooks.",
    "Starting in the later part of the 18th century, there began a transition in parts of Great Britain's previously manual labour and draft-animal-based economy towards machine-based manufacturing.",
    "The idea that a machine can be decomposed into simple movable elements led Archimedes to define the lever, pulley and screw as simple machines.",
    "The modern approach to characterizing machines focusses on the components that allow movement, known as joints.",
    "A wedge is a simple machine that transforms lateral force and movement of the tool into a transverse splitting force and movement of the workpiece.",
    "Wheel: The wheel is an important early machine, such as the chariot.",
    "The classification of simple machines to provide a strategy for the design of new machines was developed by Franz Reuleaux, who collected and studied over 800 elementary machines. He recognized that the classical simple machines can be separated into the lever, pulley and wheel and axle that are formed by a body rotating about a hinge, and the inclined plane, wedge and screw that are similarly a block sliding on a flat surface..",
    "Simple machines are elementary examples of kinematic chains or linkages that are used to model mechanical systems ranging from the steam engine to robot manipulators.",
    "This realization shows that it is the joints, or the connections that provide movement, that are the primary elements of a machine.",
    "Starting with four types of joints, the rotary joint, sliding joint, cam joint and gear joint, and related connections such as cables and belts, it is possible to understand a machine as an assembly of solid parts that connect these joints called a mechanism .."

    "The human hand usually has five digits: four fingers plus one thumb; these are often referred to collectively as five fingers, however, whereby the thumb is included as one of the fingers. It has 27 bones, not including the sesamoid bone, the number of which varies among people, 14 of which are the phalanges  of the fingers and thumb.",
    "Each human hand has five metacarpals and eight carpal bones.",
    "They also have the greatest positioning capability of the body; thus, the sense of touch is intimately associated with hands.",
    "Like other paired organs  each hand is dominantly controlled by the opposing brain hemisphere, so that handedness—the preferred hand choice for single-handed activities such as writing with a pencil, reflects individual brain functioning.",

Hotter was unable to pursue an international career until his Covent Garden debut in 1947.",
    "Probably Hotter's best known vocal achievement was his Wotan in Der Ring des Nibelungen, beginning with the Rheingold Wotan and ending with the Siegfried Wanderer, which he first sang in the German provinces in his early 20s, and adding the Walküre shortly thereafter at the German theatre in Prague; he played the roles until the mid-1960s, by which time his voice underwent a brief crisis owing to severe asthma, causing him to miss the first season of the post-war Bayreuth Festival in 1951, but he sang there for several years starting in 1952.",

The Danevirke defence structures were built in phases from the 3rd century forward and the sheer size of the construction efforts in AD 737 are attributed to the emergence of a Danish king. A new runic alphabet was first used around the same time and Ribe, the oldest town of Denmark, was founded about AD 700.",

  "eyes": [
    "Eyes are organs of the visual system.",
    "Eyes detect light and convert it into electro-chemical impulses in neurons .",
    "Eyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms, and 96% of animal species possess a complex optical system. Image-resolving eyes are present in molluscs, chordates and arthropods..",
    "The most simple eyes, pit eyes, are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angle of light that enters and affects the eye-spot, to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light. From more complex eyes, retinal photosensitive ganglion cells send signals along the retinohypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nuclei to effect circadian adjustment and to the pretectal area to control the pupillary light reflex.",
    "Complex eyes distinguish shapes and colours.",
    "In other organisms, particularly prey animals, eyes are located to maximise the field of view, such as in rabbits and horses, which have monocular vision.",
    "The first proto-eyes evolved among animals 600 million years ago about the time of the Cambrian explosion. The last common ancestor of animals possessed the biochemical toolkit necessary for vision, and more advanced eyes have evolved in 96% of animal species in six of the ~35 main phyla. In most vertebrates and some molluscs, the eye allows light to enter and project onto a light-sensitive layer of cells known as the retina.",
    "Such eyes are typically spheroid, filled with the transparent gel-like vitreous humour, possess a focusing lens, and often an iris.",
    "Muscles around the iris change the size of the pupil, regulating the amount of light that enters the eye and reducing aberrations when there is enough light. The eyes of most cephalopods, fish, amphibians and snakes have fixed lens shapes, and focusing is achieved by telescoping the lens in a similar manner to that of a camera..",
    "The compound eyes of the arthropods are composed of many simple facets which, depending on anatomical detail, may give either a single pixelated image or multiple images per eye.",
    "Some eyes have up to 28,000 such sensors arranged hexagonally, which can give a full 360° field of vision.",
    "Compound eyes are very sensitive to motion.",
    "Some arthropods, including many Strepsiptera, have compound eyes of only a few facets, each with a retina capable of creating an image.",
    "Possessing detailed hyperspectral colour vision, the Mantis shrimp has the world's most complex colour vision system. Trilobites, now extinct, had unique compound eyes.",
    "Clear calcite crystals formed the lenses of their eyes.",
    "They differ in this from most other arthropods, which have soft eyes.",
    "In contrast to compound eyes, simple eyes have a single lens.",
    "Jumping spiders have one pair of large simple eyes with a narrow field of view, augmented by an array of smaller eyes for peripheral vision.",
    "Some insect larvae, like caterpillars, have a type of simple eye  which usually provides only a rough image, but  can possess resolving powers of 4 degrees of arc, be polarization-sensitive, and capable of increasing its absolute sensitivity at night by a factor of 1,000 or more. Ocelli, some of the simplest eyes, are found in animals such as some of the snails.",
    "In organisms dwelling near deep-sea vents, compound eyes are adapted to see the infra-red light produced by the hot vents; enabling the creatures to avoid being boiled alive..",
    "There are ten different eye layouts—indeed every technological method of capturing an optical image commonly used by human beings, with the exceptions of zoom and Fresnel lenses, occur in nature. Eye types can be categorised into \"simple eyes\", with one concave photoreceptive surface, and \"compound eyes\", which comprise a number of individual lenses laid out on a convex surface. Note that \"simple\" does not imply a reduced level of complexity or acuity.",
    "The only limitations specific to eye types are that of resolution—the physics of compound eyes prevents them from achieving a resolution better than 1°.",
    "Also, superposition eyes can achieve greater sensitivity than apposition eyes, so are better suited to dark-dwelling creatures. Eyes also fall into two groups on the basis of their photoreceptor's cellular construction, with the photoreceptor cells either being cilliated  or rhabdomeric.",
    "These are not considered eyes because they lack enough structure to be considered an organ, and do not produce an image..",
    "Simple eyes are rather ubiquitous, and lens-bearing eyes have evolved at least seven times in vertebrates, cephalopods, annelids, crustaceans and cubozoa..",
    "Pit eyes, also known as stemma, are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angles of light that enters and affects the eye-spot, to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light. Found in about 85% of phyla, these basic forms were probably the precursors to more advanced types of \"simple eyes\".",
    "Pit vipers have developed pits that function as eyes by sensing thermal infra-red radiation, in addition to their optical wavelength eyes like those of other vertebrates .",
    "The resolution of pit eyes can be greatly improved by incorporating a material with a higher refractive index to form a lens, which may greatly reduce the blur radius encountered—hence increasing the resolution obtainable. The most basic form, seen in some gastropods and annelids, consists of a lens of one refractive index.",
    "Heterogeneous eyes have evolved at least nine times: four or more times in gastropods, once in the copepods, once in the annelids, once in the cephalopods, and once in the chitons, which have aragonite lenses. No extant aquatic organisms possess homogeneous lenses; presumably the evolutionary pressure for a heterogeneous lens is great enough for this stage to be quickly \"outgrown\"..",
    "To minimise the effect of eye motion while the animal moves, most such eyes have stabilising eye muscles.."

After reading works by Ernest Hemingway, he had decided in his youth that, like Hemingway, he wanted to be a foreign correspondent. He attended Harbord Collegiate Institute and Bloor Collegiate Institute in Toronto, Ontario, and briefly attended the University of Western Ontario before he dropped out to become a newspaper reporter.

    "In 1812, Geoffroy grouped the apes and the Cercopithecidae group of monkeys together and established the name Catarrhini, \"Old World monkeys\", . The extant sister of the Catarrhini in the monkey  group is the Platyrrhini . Some nine million years before the divergence between the Cercopithecidae and the apes, the Platyrrhini emerged within \"monkeys\" by migration to South America from Afro-Arabia , likely by ocean. Apes are thus deep in the tree of extant and extinct monkeys, and any of the apes is distinctly closer related to the Cercopithecidae than the Platyrrhini are.",

That apes are monkeys was already realized by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in the 18th century. Linnaeus placed this group in 1758 together with the tarsiers, in a single genus \"Simia\" , an ensemble now recognised as the Haplorhini..",
    "Monkeys, including apes, can be distinguished from other primates by having only two pectoral nipples, a pendulous penis, and a lack of sensory whiskers..",

Monkeys thus constituted a \"grade\" on the path to humans and were distinguished from \"apes\".",

    "Various studies have shown that older sisters are likely to give a varied gender role to their younger siblings, as well as being more likely to develop a close bond with their younger siblings. Older sisters are more likely to play with their younger siblings. Younger siblings display a more needy behavior when in close proximity to their older sister and are more likely to be tolerant of an older sister's bad behavior. Boys with only an older sister are more likely to display stereotypically male behavior, and such masculine boys increased their masculine behavior with the more sisters they have. The reverse is true for young boys with several sisters, as they tend to be feminine, however, they outgrow this by the time they approach pubescence. Boys with older sisters were less likely to be delinquent or have emotional and behavioral disorders. A younger sister is less likely to be scolded by older siblings than a younger brother. The most common recreational activity between older brother/younger sister pairs is art drawing. Some studies also found a correlation between having an older sister and constructive discussions about safe sexual practices. Some studies have shown that men without sisters are more likely to be ineffectual at courtship and romantic relationships..",

A study in Perth, Australia found that girls having only youngers brothers resulted in a chastity effect: losing their virginity on average more than a year later than average.",
    "Various studies have shown that older sisters are likely to give a varied gender role to their younger siblings, as well as being more likely to develop a close bond with their younger siblings. Older sisters are more likely to play with their younger siblings. Younger siblings display a more needy behavior when in close proximity to their older sister and are more likely to be tolerant of an older sister's bad behavior. Boys with only an older sister are more likely to display stereotypically male behavior, and such masculine boys increased their masculine behavior with the more sisters they have. The reverse is true for young boys with several sisters, as they tend to be feminine, however, they outgrow this by the time they approach pubescence. Boys with older sisters were less likely to be delinquent or have emotional and behavioral disorders. A younger sister is less likely to be scolded by older siblings than a younger brother. The most common recreational activity between older brother/younger sister pairs is art drawing. Some studies also found a correlation between having an older sister and constructive discussions about safe sexual practices. Some studies have shown that men without sisters are more likely to be ineffectual at courtship and romantic relationships..",

    "Manama  is the capital and largest city of Bahrain, with an approximate population of 200,000 people as of 2020.",
    "Long an important trading center in the Persian Gulf, Manama is home to a very diverse population.",
    "Although the current twin cities of Manama and Muharraq appear to have been founded simultaneously in the 1800s, Muharraq took prominence due to its defensive location and was thus the capital of Bahrain until 1923.",
    "Manama became the mercantile capital and was the gateway to the main Bahrain Island. In the 20th century, Bahrain's oil wealth helped spur fast growth and in the 1990s a concerted diversification effort led to expansion in other industries and helped transform Manama into an important financial hub in the Middle East.",
    "Manama was designated as the 2012 capital of Arab culture by the Arab League, and a beta global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network in 2018..",
    "During this time, Bahrain was engaged in long distance marine trading, evident from the discovery of Chinese coins dating between 600 and 1200 AD, in Manama..",
    "The town of Manama was mentioned by name for the first time in a manuscript dating to 1345 AD. Bahrain, particularly Manama and the nearby settlement of Bilad Al Qadeem, became a centre of Shia scholarship and training for the ulema, it would remain so for centuries.",
    "In 1521, Bahrain fell to the expanding Portuguese Empire in the Persian Gulf, having already defeated Hormuz. The Portuguese consolidated their hold on the island by constructing the Bahrain Fort, on the outskirts of Manama. After numerous revolts and an expanding Safavid empire in Persia, the Portuguese were expelled from Bahrain and the Safavids took control in 1602..",
    "The Safavids, sidelining Manama, designated the nearby town of Bilad Al Qadeem as the provincial capital. The town was also the seat of the Persian governor and the Shaikh al-Islam of the islands.",
    "The yearly income of exported Bahraini pearls was 600,000 ducats, collected by around 2,000 pearling dhows. Another factor that contributed to Bahrain's agricultural wealth was the migration of Shia cultivators from Ottoman-occupied Qatif and al-Hasa, fearing religious persecution, in 1537. Sometime after 1736, Nader Shah constructed a fort on the southern outskirts of Manama ..",
    "Political instability in the 19th century had disastrous effects on Manama's economy; Invasions by the Omanis in 1800 and by the Wahhabis in 1810–11, in addition to a civil war in 1842 between Bahrain's co-rulers saw the town being a major battleground.",
    "The instability paralysed commercial trade in Manama; the town's port was closed, most merchants fled abroad to Kuwait and the Persian coast until hostilities ceased. The English scholar William Gifford Palgrave, on a visit to Manama in 1862, described the town as having a few ruined stone buildings, with a landscape dominated with the huts of poor fishermen and pearl-divers..",
    "With the ascension of Isa ibn Ali Al Khalifa as the Hakim of Bahrain in 1869, Manama became the centre of British activity in the Persian Gulf, though its interests were initially strictly commercial. Trading recovered fully by 1873 and the country's earnings from pearl exports increased by sevenfold between 1873 and 1900. Representing the British were native agents, usually from minorities such as Persians or Huwala who regularly reported back to British India and the British political residency in Bushehr. The position of native agent was later replaced by a British political agent, following the construction of the British political residency  in 1900, which further solidified Britain's position in Manama..",
    "Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the British Raj used Manama as a military base of operations during the Mesopotamian campaign. Prompted by the presence of oil in the region, the British political agency in Bushire concluded an oil agreement with the Hakim to prohibit the exploration and exploitation of oil for a five-year period.",
    "A municipal government was established in Manama in 1919, the Customs office was reorganised in 1923 and placed under the supervision of an English businessman, the pearling industry was later reformed in 1924.",
    "In 1947, following the end of the war and subsequent Indian independence, the British residency of the Persian Gulf moved to Manama from Bushire..",
    "Following the rise of Arab nationalism across the Middle East and sparked by the Suez Crisis in 1956, anti-British unrest broke out in Manama, organised by the National Union Committee.",
    "Another anti-British uprising erupted in March 1965, though predominately led by students aspiring for independence rather than by Arab nationalists. In 1968, the British announced their withdrawal from Bahrain by 1971. The newly independent State of Bahrain designated Manama as the capital city..",
    "Post-independence Manama was characterised by the rapid urbanisation of the city and the swallowing-up of neighboring villages and hamlets into a single urbanised area, incorporating new neighbourhoods such as Adliya and Salmaniya.",
    "The scarcity of land suitable for construction led to land reclamation. Religious activism migrated from Manama to the suburban districts of Bani Jamra, Diraz and Bilad Al Qadeem, hotspots of unrest in the 1990s uprising that called for the reinstatement of an elected parliament. In 2001, the National Action Charter, presented by King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa was approved by Bahrainis.",
    "Historically, Manama has been restricted to what is now known as the Manama Souq and the Manama Fort  to its south.",
    "The districts that make up Manama today include:.",
    "Manama is part of the Capital Governorate, one of five Governorates of Bahrain.",
    "Until 2002 it was part of the municipality of Al-Manamah.",
    "Manama is the focal point of the Bahraini economy.",
    "Several multinationals have facilities and offices in and around Manama. The primary industry in Manama itself is financial services, with over two hundred financial institutions and banks based in the CBD and the Diplomatic Area.",
    "Manama is a financial hub for the Persian Gulf region and a center of Islamic banking.",
    "There is also a large retail sector in the shopping malls around Seef, while the center of Manama is dominated by small workshops and traders.",
    "Manama's economy in the early 20th century relied heavily on pearling; in 1907, the pearling industry was estimated to include 917 boats providing employment for up to 18,000 people.",
    "Shipbuilding also employed several hundred in both Manama and Muharraq."

    "This theory holds that the name Nicaragua was formed from Nicarao and agua , to reference the fact that there are two large lakes and several other bodies of water within the country. However, as of 2002, it was determined that the cacique's real name was Macuilmiquiztli, which meant \"Five Deaths\" in the Nahuatl language, rather than Nicarao..",

One problem for this view is to explain how humans can learn and think about Platonic forms belonging to a different realm.

    "In 1704 Peter the Great finally reformed the old Russian monetary system, minting a silver ruble coin of weight 28.1 g  and 72% fineness; hence 20.22 g fine silver. The decision to subdivide it primarily into 100 copper kopeks, rather than 200 Muscovite denga, made the Russian ruble the world's first decimal currency..",

    "Brightness is an antonym of dimness or dullness.",
    "The United States Federal Trade Commission  has assigned an unconventional meaning to brightness when applied to lamps.",

  "free": [
    "Free may refer to:.",
    "Free will is the capacity or ability to choose between different possible courses of action unimpeded..",
    "Free will is closely linked to the concepts of moral responsibility, praise, culpability, sin, and other judgements which apply only to actions that are freely chosen.",
    "Traditionally, only actions that are freely willed are seen as deserving credit or blame.",
    "Whether free will exists, what it is and the implications of whether it exists or not are some of the longest running debates of philosophy and religion.",
    "Some conceive of free will as the ability to act beyond the limits of external influences or wishes.",
    "Some conceive free will to be the capacity to make choices undetermined by past events.",
    "Determinism suggests that only one course of events is possible, which is inconsistent with a libertarian model of free will. Ancient Greek philosophy identified this issue, which remains a major focus of philosophical debate.",
    "The view that conceives free will as incompatible with determinism is called incompatibilism and encompasses both metaphysical libertarianism  and hard determinism .",
    "Incompatibilism also encompasses hard incompatibilism, which holds not only determinism but also indeterminism to be incompatible with free will and thus free will to be impossible whatever the case may be regarding determinism.",
    "In contrast, compatibilists hold that free will is compatible with determinism.",
    "Some compatibilists even hold that determinism is necessary for free will, arguing that choice involves preference for one course of action over another, requiring a sense of how choices will turn out. Compatibilists thus consider the debate between libertarians and hard determinists over free will vs.",
    "determinism a false dilemma. Different compatibilists offer very different definitions of what \"free will\" means and consequently find different types of constraints to be relevant to the issue.",
    "Classical compatibilists considered free will nothing more than freedom of action, considering one free of will simply if, had one counterfactually wanted to do otherwise, one could have done otherwise without physical impediment.",
    "Contemporary compatibilists instead identify free will as a psychological capacity, such as to direct one's behavior in a way responsive to reason, and there are still further different conceptions of free will, each with their own concerns, sharing only the common feature of not finding the possibility of determinism a threat to the possibility of free will..",
    "The problem of free will has been identified in ancient Greek philosophical literature.",
    "The notion of compatibilist free will has been attributed to both Aristotle  and Epictetus ; \"it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them\". According to Susanne Bobzien, the notion of incompatibilist free will is perhaps first identified in the works of Alexander of Aphrodisias ; \"what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them\".",
    "The term \"free will\"  was introduced by Christian philosophy .",
    "It has traditionally meant  lack of necessity in human will, so that \"the will is free\" meant \"the will does not have to be such as it is\".",
    "On one hand, humans have a strong sense of freedom, which leads them to believe that they have free will. On the other hand, an intuitive feeling of free will could be mistaken..",
    "It is difficult to reconcile the intuitive evidence that conscious decisions are causally effective with the view that the physical world can be explained entirely by physical law. The conflict between intuitively felt freedom and natural law arises when either causal closure or physical determinism  is asserted.",
    "The puzzle of reconciling 'free will' with a deterministic universe is known as the problem of free will or sometimes referred to as the dilemma of determinism. This dilemma leads to a moral dilemma as well: the question of how to assign responsibility for actions if they are caused entirely by past events..",
    "Compatibilists maintain that mental reality is not of itself causally effective. Classical compatibilists have addressed the dilemma of free will by arguing that free will holds as long as humans are not externally constrained or coerced. Modern compatibilists make a distinction between freedom of will and freedom of action, that is, separating freedom of choice from the freedom to enact it. Given that humans all experience a sense of free will, some modern compatibilists think it is necessary to accommodate this intuition. Compatibilists often associate freedom of will with the ability to make rational decisions.",
    "A different approach to the dilemma is that of incompatibilists, namely, that if the world is deterministic, then our feeling that we are free to choose an action is simply an illusion.",
    "Metaphysical libertarianism is the form of incompatibilism which posits that determinism is false and free will is possible . This view is associated with non-materialist constructions, including both traditional dualism, as well as models supporting more minimal criteria; such as the ability to consciously veto an action or competing desire. Yet even with physical indeterminism, arguments have been made against libertarianism in that it is difficult to assign Origination .",
    "Free will here is predominantly treated with respect to physical determinism in the strict sense of nomological determinism, although other forms of determinism are also relevant to free will. For example, logical and theological determinism challenge metaphysical libertarianism with ideas of destiny and fate, and biological, cultural and psychological determinism feed the development of compatibilist models.",
    "Incompatibilism is the position that free will and determinism are logically incompatible, and that the major question regarding whether or not people have free will is thus whether or not their actions are determined.",
    "\"Hard determinists\", such as d'Holbach, are those incompatibilists who accept determinism and reject free will.",
    "In contrast, \"metaphysical libertarians\", such as Thomas Reid, Peter van Inwagen, and Robert Kane, are those incompatibilists who accept free will and deny determinism, holding the view that some form of indeterminism is true. Another view is that of hard incompatibilists, which state that free will is incompatible with both determinism and indeterminism..",
    "Traditional arguments for incompatibilism are based on an \"intuition pump\": if a person is like other mechanical things that are determined in their behavior such as a wind-up toy, a billiard ball, a puppet, or a robot, then people must not have free will. This argument has been rejected by compatibilists such as Daniel Dennett on the grounds that, even if humans have something in common with these things, it remains possible and plausible that we are different from such objects in important ways.."

    "The Move were a British rock band of the late 1960s and the early 1970s.",
    "They scored nine top 20 UK singles in five years, but were among the most popular British bands not to find any real success in the United States. For most of their career the Move were led by guitarist, singer and songwriter Roy Wood.",
    "The Move evolved from several mid-1960s Birmingham-based groups, including Carl Wayne & the Vikings, the Nightriders and the Mayfair Set.",
    "Their name referred to the move various members of these bands made to form the group. Besides Wood, the Move's original five-piece line-up in 1965 was drummer Bev Bevan, bassist Ace Kefford, vocalist Carl Wayne and guitarist Trevor Burton. By 1972, the Move had been reduced to a trio consisting of Wood, Bevan and Jeff Lynne, formerly of the Idle Race.",
    "The band's later years saw this lineup develop a side project called Electric Light Orchestra, which would go on to achieve major international success after the Move's disbandment.",
    "Between 2007 and 2014, Burton and Bevan performed intermittently as \"The Move featuring Bev Bevan and Trevor Burton\".",
    "The Move were formed in December 1965, and played their debut show at the Belfry, Wishaw, on 23 January 1966.",
    "At the time, the Move mainly played covers of American west coast groups such as the Byrds together with Motown and rock 'n' roll songs.",
    "Secunda got them a weekly residency at London's Marquee Club in 1966, where they appeared dressed as gangsters. Their early career was marked by a series of publicity stunts, high-profile media events and outrageous stage antics masterminded by Secunda; they included Wayne taking an axe to television sets. Wood was uncomfortable with this sensationalism, and many concert promoters responded by banning The Move from live performances, but it succeeded in drawing media attention and concert audiences to the group. Eventually, Secunda also managed to persuade Wood to begin writing songs for the band during his time off. They secured a production contract with independent record producer Denny Cordell, but that was turned into a media event by Secunda, who arranged for the band to sign their contracts on the back of Liz Wilson, a topless female model.",
    "2 hit on the UK Singles Chart in January 1967, which began the Move's practice of musical quotation . Their second single, \"I Can Hear the Grass Grow\", was another major hit, reaching No.",

    "Wilson sued the Move for libel and the group lost the court case; they had to pay all costs, and all royalties earned by the song were awarded to charities of Wilson's choice. The ruling remained in force even after Wilson's death in 1995. In the Family Trees documentary special on the Birmingham music scene, Wood says that while the band as a whole lost their royalties, it affected him the most, as he wrote the song..",
    "However, the Move had been unnerved by their court experiences; they and the record label felt it unwise to pursue such a potentially controversial idea, so the single was shelved.",
    "\"Vote For Me\" remained unreleased until it appeared on retrospective collections from 1997 onwards, while \"Cherry Blossom Clinic\" became one of the tracks on their first LP, called Move..",
    "As a direct consequence of the lawsuit, the Move fired Secunda and hired Don Arden, who had himself recently been fired as manager of the Small Faces.",
    "During November and December 1967 the group took part in another package tour around the UK, playing two shows a night over sixteen days, as part of an all-star bill that included the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Pink Floyd, the Nice, Eire Apparent, the Outer Limits, Amen Corner, along with then-BBC Radio 1 DJ Pete Drummond. In March 1968, the Move returned to the charts with \"Fire Brigade\", another UK Top 3 hit, and the first on which Wood sang lead vocal.",
    "A few weeks later, around the time of the LP's release, Kefford was let go from the band due to increasing personal problems, escalated by drug usage. Wood stated that from the day the band was founded, Kefford had not got along well with any of the other band members. The Move then became a four-piece, in which Burton and  Wayne took turns on bass on stage..",
    "The Move were on the bill at the inaugural Isle of Wight Festival on 31 August 1968.",
    "In mid-1968, their fifth single \"Wild Tiger Woman\", a song acknowledging the group's love of Jimi Hendrix, , sold poorly and failed to make the UK chart. The Move responded with their most commercially successful song to date, \"Blackberry Way\" , which topped the UK chart in February 1969. Wayne refused to sing the song, so it was recorded as a trio with Wood again handling lead vocal. Richard Tandy played keyboards on \"Blackberry Way\" and joined the band for a time, playing keyboards live, and switching to bass when Burton was briefly sidelined with a shoulder injury. Upon Burton's recovery, Tandy departed to join the Uglys. The new, more pop-oriented musical direction, and the single hitting number one was the last straw for the increasingly disenchanted Burton, who wanted to work in a more hard rock/blues-oriented style, and he left the group in February 1969 after an altercation on stage with Bevan in Sweden..",
    "It was rumoured in the music press that Hank Marvin of the recently disbanded Shadows had been invited to join the Move.",
    "Some years later, Wayne recalled that to be nothing more than a publicity stunt; however, Marvin himself, in an article in Melody Maker in 1973 and elsewhere, has maintained that he was approached by Wood and invited to join the Move, but declined because their schedule was too hectic for him. Bevan confirmed in a 2014 interview that the band invited Marvin, but they never expected him to accept. Burton was ultimately replaced in 1969 by Rick Price, another veteran of several Birmingham rock groups, who joined on a temporary, non-contractual basis. Thus, the group in spring 1969 consisted of Wayne , Wood , Bevan , and Price .",
    "Both Ace Kefford and Trevor Burton struggled commercially after leaving the Move.",
    "In October 1969 the Move made their only concert appearances in the US, opening two shows for the Stooges in Detroit, and playing dates in Los Angeles and at the Fillmore West in San Francisco.",
    "During that period, Arden sold the Move's management contract to impresario Peter Walsh, who was at the time also managing the Marmalade. Walsh, who specialised in cabaret acts, began booking the band into cabaret-style venues, which further increased the tension between Wayne and Wood. Bevan later said the others felt \"old before their time\" when playing cabaret dates.",
    "The Move's second album, 1970's Shazam, continued the Move's practice of musical quotation, and of elaborately re-arranged versions of other performers' songs.",
    "Despite such superficial similarities with their past, however, the album represented a clear break from the Move's identity as a pop group, reintroducing them as a hard-edged underground band. Burton played bass on a couple of tracks as they had been recorded before he left, although this was not credited at the time..",
    "Well aware that Wood was intent on setting up his new, orchestral rock project, Wayne suggested that Wood concentrate on performing with his new band while continuing to write songs for the Move, which would be reorganized with a lineup consisting of Wayne, Burton, and Kefford; however, his suggestion was rejected by Wood, Bevan and Price, so after getting angry and embarrassed witnessing a fight between Wood and a drunken audience member in Sheffield, Wayne quit the group in January 1970, a month before the release of Shazam. He subsequently worked in a variety of musical ventures and appeared on television and radio.",
    "Upon Wayne's departure, the Move jettisoned Walsh as manager and returned to Arden.",
    "Feeling nervous as the band were about to go on stage for a television spot for the song, Wood spontaneously combed his hair out to make it look wild and applied black-and-white makeup with a star in the middle of his forehead, thus birthing the \"Wizzard\" image he would use extensively in his post-Move career and helping define the Move's image for the rest of their run. Soon afterward, the band toured Ireland and Germany."

Various cosmological models of the Big Bang explain the evolution of the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale form. These models offer a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background  radiation, and large-scale structure.",
    "However, physics currently lacks a widely accepted theory of quantum gravity that can successfully model the earliest conditions of the Big Bang.",
    "Extrapolating this cosmic expansion backwards in time using the known laws of physics, the models describe an increasingly concentrated cosmos preceded by a singularity in which space and time lose meaning . In 1964 the CMB was discovered, which convinced many cosmologists that the competing steady-state model of cosmic evolution was falsified, since the Big Bang models predict a uniform background radiation caused by high temperatures and densities in the distant past.",
    "A wide range of empirical evidence strongly favors the Big Bang event, which is now essentially universally accepted. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang singularity at an estimated 13.787±0.020 billion years ago, which is considered the age of the universe..",
    "There remain aspects of the observed universe that are not yet adequately explained by the Big Bang models.",
    "Most of the gravitational potential in the universe seems to be in this form, and the Big Bang models and various observations indicate that this excess gravitational potential is not created by baryonic matter, such as normal atoms.",
    "The Big Bang models offer a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundances of the light elements, the CMB, large-scale structure, and Hubble's law. The models depend on two major assumptions: the universality of physical laws and the cosmological principle.",
    "The expansion of the Universe was inferred from early twentieth century astronomical observations and is an essential ingredient of the Big Bang models.",
    "The Big Bang is not an explosion of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe.",
    "In other words, the Big Bang is not an explosion in space, but rather an expansion of space. Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our universe only on large scales—local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy do not necessarily expand with the same speed as the whole Universe..",
    "An important feature of the Big Bang spacetime is the presence of particle horizons.",
    "According to the Big Bang models, the universe at the beginning was very hot and very compact, and since then it has been expanding and cooling down.",
    "This primordial singularity is itself sometimes called \"the Big Bang\", but the term can also refer to a more generic early hot, dense phase of the universe.",
    "In either case, \"the Big Bang\" as an event is also colloquially referred to as the \"birth\" of our universe since it represents the point in history where the universe can be verified to have entered into a regime where the laws of physics as we understand them  work.",
    "Commonly used calculations and limits for explaining gravitational collapse are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size, such as stars, and do not apply to rapidly expanding space such as the Big Bang.",
    "The earliest phases of the Big Bang are subject to much speculation, since astronomical data about them are not available.",
    "A few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion kelvin and the density of matter in the universe was comparable to the current density of Earth's atmosphere, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's deuterium and helium nuclei in a process called Big Bang nucleosynthesis . Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei..",
    "English astronomer Fred Hoyle is credited with coining the term \"Big Bang\" during a talk for a March 1949 BBC Radio broadcast, saying: \"These theories were based on the hypothesis that all the matter in the universe was created in one big bang at a particular time in the remote past.\" However, it did not catch on until the 1970s..",
    "Rather than expanding into space, the Big Bang was the expansion/stretching of space itself, everywhere simultaneously , causing the universe to cool down and the density to be lowered. Another issue pointed out by Santhosh Mathew is that bang implies sound, which would require a vibrating particle and medium through which it travels.",
    "Since this is the beginning of anything we can imagine, there is no basis for any sound, and thus the Big Bang was likely silent. An attempt to find a more suitable alternative was not successful..",
    "The Big Bang models developed from observations of the structure of the universe and from theoretical considerations.",
    "In the 1920s and 1930s, almost every major cosmologist preferred an eternal steady-state universe, and several complained that the beginning of time implied by the Big Bang imported religious concepts into physics; this objection was later repeated by supporters of the steady-state theory. This perception was enhanced by the fact that the originator of the Big Bang concept, Lemaître, was a Roman Catholic priest. Arthur Eddington agreed with Aristotle that the universe did not have a beginning in time, viz., that matter is eternal.",
    "In this model the universe is roughly the same at any point in time. The other was Lemaître's Big Bang theory, advocated and developed by George Gamow, who introduced BBN and whose associates, Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman, predicted the CMB. Ironically, it was Hoyle who coined the phrase that came to be applied to Lemaître's theory, referring to it as \"this big bang idea\" during a BBC Radio broadcast in March 1949. For a while, support was split between these two theories.",
    "Eventually, the observational evidence, most notably from radio source counts, began to favor Big Bang over steady state.",
    "The discovery and confirmation of the CMB in 1964 secured the Big Bang as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the universe..",
    "Ellis published papers where they showed that mathematical singularities were an inevitable initial condition of relativistic models of the Big Bang. Then, from the 1970s to the 1990s, cosmologists worked on characterizing the features of the Big Bang universe and resolving outstanding problems.",
    "In 1981, Alan Guth made a breakthrough in theoretical work on resolving certain outstanding theoretical problems in the Big Bang models with the introduction of an epoch of rapid expansion in the early universe he called \"inflation\". Meanwhile, during these decades, two questions in observational cosmology that generated much discussion and disagreement were over the precise values of the Hubble Constant and the matter-density of the universe ..",
    "Significant progress in Big Bang cosmology has been made since the late 1990s as a result of advances in telescope technology as well as the analysis of data from satellites such as the Cosmic Background Explorer , the Hubble Space Telescope and WMAP. Cosmologists now have fairly precise and accurate measurements of many of the parameters of the Big Bang model, and have made the unexpected discovery that the expansion of the universe appears to be accelerating..",
    "On 30 January 2023, news reported the discovery of a 1964 20-minute interview, considered lost, of cosmologist Georges Lemaître, who pioneered the notion of the Big Bang theory.."

  "warm": [
    "Warm, WARM, or Warmth may refer to:.",
    "In common usage, climate change describes global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its effects on Earth's climate system.",
    "The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane. Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight.",
    "Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming.",
    "Due to climate change, deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct. Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries.",
    "Many climate change impacts are already felt at the current 1.2 °C  level of warming.",
    "Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming \"well under 2 °C\".",
    "However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 °C  by the end of the century. Limiting warming to 1.5 °C will require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050..",
    "Before the 1980s, when it was unclear whether the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases were stronger than the cooling effect of airborne particulates in air pollution, scientists used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to human impacts on the climate..",
    "In the 1980s, the terms global warming and climate change became more common.",
    "Though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably, scientifically, global warming refers only to increased surface warming, while climate change describes the totality of changes to Earth's climate system. Global warming—used as early as 1975—became the more popular term after NASA climate scientist James Hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in the U.S.",
    "Various scientists, politicians and media now use the terms climate crisis or climate emergency to talk about climate change, and global heating instead of global warming..",
    "Multiple independent instrumental datasets show that the climate system is warming. The 2011–2020 decade warmed to an average 1.09 °C  compared to the pre-industrial baseline . Surface temperatures are rising by about 0.2 °C per decade, with 2020 reaching a temperature of 1.2 °C above the pre-industrial era. Since 1950, the number of cold days and nights has decreased, and the number of warm days and nights has increased..",
    "There was little net warming between the 18th century and the mid-19th century.",
    "Climate information for that period comes from climate proxies, such as trees and ice cores. Thermometer records began to provide global coverage around 1850. Historical patterns of warming and cooling, like the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, did not occur at the same time across different regions.",
    "Temperatures may have reached as high as those of the late-20th century in a limited set of regions. There have been prehistorical episodes of global warming, such as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. However, the modern observed rise in temperature and CO2 concentrations has been so rapid that even abrupt geophysical events in Earth's history do not approach current rates..",
    "Evidence of warming from air temperature measurements are reinforced with a wide range of other observations. For example, changes to the natural water cycle have been predicted and observed, such as an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, melting of snow and land ice, and increased atmospheric humidity. Flora and fauna are also behaving in a manner consistent with warming; for instance, plants are flowering earlier in spring. Another key indicator is the cooling of the upper atmosphere, which demonstrates that greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the Earth's surface and preventing it from radiating into space..",
    "Regions of the world warm at differing rates.",
    "Since the pre-industrial period, the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global-average surface temperature. This is because of the larger heat capacity of oceans, and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation. The thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970, and over 90% of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean. The rest has heated the atmosphere, melted ice, and warmed the continents..",
    "The Northern Hemisphere and the North Pole have warmed much faster than the South Pole and Southern Hemisphere.",
    "As these surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted, they start absorbing more heat. Local black carbon deposits on snow and ice also contribute to Arctic warming. Arctic temperatures are increasing at over twice the rate of the rest of the world. Melting of glaciers and ice sheets in the Arctic disrupts ocean circulation, including a weakened Gulf Stream, further changing the climate..",
    "Its fingerprint would be warming in the entire atmosphere.",
    "Yet, only the lower atmosphere has warmed, consistent with greenhouse gas forcing. Attribution of recent climate change shows that the main driver is elevated greenhouse gases, with aerosols having a dampening effect..",
    "This absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space, trapping heat near the Earth's surface and warming it over time. Before the Industrial Revolution, naturally-occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33 °C warmer than it would have been in their absence. While water vapour  and clouds  are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect, they increase as a function of temperature and are therefore feedbacks.",
    "This phenomenon is popularly known as global dimming, and is attributed to aerosols produced by dust, pollution and combustion of biofuels and fossil fuels.    Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990 due to pollution controls, meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much..",
    "While aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight, black carbon in soot that falls on snow or ice can contribute to global warming.",
    "Not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight, it also increases melting and sea-level rise. Limiting new black carbon deposits in the Arctic could reduce global warming by 0.2 °C by 2050..",
    "Today, agriculture takes up 34% of Earth's land area, while 26% is forests, and 30% is uninhabitable . The amount of forested land continues to decrease, which is the main land use change that causes global warming. Deforestation releases CO2 contained in trees when they are destroyed, plus it prevents those trees from absorbing more CO2 in the future. The main causes of deforestation are: permanent land-use change from forest to agricultural land producing products such as beef and palm oil , logging to produce forestry/forest products , short term shifting cultivation , and wildfires ..",
    "Deforestation can also affect temperatures by modifying the release of chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns. In tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming, while at latitudes closer to the poles a gain of albedo  leads to a cooling effect. Globally, these effects are estimated to have led to a slight cooling, dominated by an increase in surface albedo..",
    "Physical climate models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when taking into account only variations in solar output and volcanic activity. Further evidence for greenhouse gases causing global warming comes from measurements that show a warming of the lower atmosphere , coupled with a cooling of the upper atmosphere . If solar variations were responsible for the observed warming, the troposphere and stratosphere would both warm.."

In the region of modern-day Pakistan, key cities during the Mughal period were Lahore and Thatta, both of which were chosen as the site of impressive Mughal buildings. In the early 16th century, the region remained under the Mughal Empire..",

    "None of the territory of modern Pakistan was ruled by the British, or other European powers, until 1839, when Karachi, then a small fishing village with a mud fort guarding the harbour, was taken, and held as an enclave with a port and military base for the First Afghan War that soon followed.",

    "In his presidential address of 29 December 1930, Allama Iqbal called for \"the amalgamation of North-West Muslim-majority Indian states\" consisting of Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, Sind, and Baluchistan. The perceived neglect of Muslim interests by Congress led British provincial governments during the period of 1937–39 convinced Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan to espouse the two-nation theory and led the Muslim League to adopt the Lahore Resolution of 1940 presented by Sher-e-Bangla A.K.",

    "As the cabinet mission failed, the British government announced its intention to end the British Rule in 1946–47. Nationalists in British India—including Jawaharlal Nehru and Abul Kalam Azad of Congress, Jinnah of the All-India Muslim League, and Master Tara Singh representing the Sikhs—agreed to the proposed terms of transfer of power and independence in June 1947 with the Viceroy of India, Lord Mountbatten of Burma. As the United Kingdom agreed to the partitioning of India in 1947, the modern state of Pakistan was established on 14 August 1947 , amalgamating the Muslim-majority eastern and northwestern regions of British India. It comprised the provinces of Balochistan, East Bengal, the North-West Frontier Province, West Punjab, and Sindh..",
    "In the riots that accompanied the partition in Punjab Province, it is believed that between 200,000 and 2,000,000 people were killed in what some have described as a retributive genocide between the religions while 50,000 Muslim women were abducted and raped by Hindu and Sikh men, 33,000 Hindu and Sikh women also experienced the same fate at the hands of Muslims. Around 6.5 million Muslims moved from India to West Pakistan and 4.7 million Hindus and Sikhs moved from West Pakistan to India. It was the largest mass migration in human history. A subsequent dispute over the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir eventually sparked the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948..",

Meanwhile, Pakistan's founding fathers agreed to appoint Liaquat Ali Khan, the secretary-general of the party, the nation's first Prime Minister.",
    "From 1947 to 1956, Pakistan was a monarchy within the Commonwealth of Nations, and had two monarchs before it became a republic..",
    "The creation of Pakistan was never fully accepted by many British leaders, among them Lord Mountbatten. Mountbatten clearly expressed his lack of support and faith in the Muslim League's idea of Pakistan. Jinnah refused Mountbatten's offer to serve as Governor-General of Pakistan. When Mountbatten was asked by Collins and Lapierre if he would have sabotaged Pakistan had he known that Jinnah was dying of tuberculosis, he replied 'most probably'..",

    "The English word girl first appeared during the Middle Ages between 1250 and 1300 CE and came from the Anglo-Saxon word gerle . The Anglo-Saxon word gerela meaning dress or clothing item also seems to have been used as a metonym in some sense.

    "When it took over the top spot in 2019, Avengers: Endgame became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before Avatar reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.",
    "Some sources claim that The Big Parade superseded The Birth of a Nation as highest-grossing film, eventually being replaced by Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which in turn was quickly usurped by Gone with the Wind. Exact figures are not known for The Birth of a Nation, but contemporary records put its worldwide earnings at $5.2 million as of 1919. Its international release was delayed by World War I, and it was not released in many foreign territories until the 1920s; coupled with further re-releases in the United States, its $10 million earnings as reported by Variety in 1932 are consistent with the earlier figure. At this time, Variety still had The Birth of a Nation ahead of The Big Parade  on distributor rentals and—if its estimate is correct—Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs  would not have earned enough on its first theatrical run to take the record; although it would have been the highest-grossing 'talkie', displacing The Singing Fool . Although received wisdom holds that it is unlikely The Birth of a Nation was ever overtaken by a silent-era film, the record would fall to 1925's Ben-Hur  if The Birth of a Nation earned significantly less than its estimated gross. In addition to its gross rental earnings through public exhibition, The Birth of a Nation played at a large number of private, club and organizational engagements which figures are unavailable for. It was hugely popular with the Ku Klux Klan who used it to drive recruitment, and at one point Variety estimated its total earnings to stand at around $50 million. Despite later retracting the claim, the sum has been widely reported even though it has never been substantiated. While it is generally accepted that Gone with the Wind took over the record of highest-grossing film on its initial release—which is true in terms of public exhibition—it is likely it did not overtake The Birth of a Nation in total revenue until a much later date, with it still being reported as the highest earner up until the 1960s. Gone with the Wind itself may have been briefly overtaken by The Ten Commandments , which closed at the end of 1960 with worldwide rentals of $58–60 million compared to Gone with the Wind's $59 million; if it did claim the top spot its tenure there was short-lived, since Gone with the Wind was re-released the following year and increased its earnings to $67 million.",

One hypothesis for why this occurs, the “rain tread” hypothesis, posits that the wrinkles may help the fingers grip things when wet, possibly being an adaption from a time when humans dealt with rain and dew in forested primate habitats. A 2013 study supporting this hypothesis found that the wrinkled fingertips provided better handling of wet objects but gave no advantage for handling dry objects. However, a 2014 study attempting to reproduce these results was unable to demonstrate any improvement of handling wet objects with wrinkled fingertips..",

    "Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, leading to a distinct Gallo-Roman culture that laid the foundation of the French language.",
    "From the mid-14th to the mid-15th century, France was plunged into a series of dynastic conflicts involving England, collectively known as the Hundred Years' War, and a distinct French identity emerged as a result.",
    "The French Renaissance saw art and culture flourish, conflict with the House of Habsburg, and the establishment of a global colonial empire, which by the 20th century would become the second-largest in the world. The second half of the 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars between Catholics and Huguenots that severely weakened the country.",

    "Algeria and most French colonies became independent in the 1960s, with the majority retaining close economic and military ties with France.",
    "The name of the Franks is related to the English word frank : the latter stems from the Old French franc , ultimately from Medieval Latin francus , a generalisation of the tribal name that emerged as a Late Latin borrowing of the reconstructed Frankish endonym *Frank. It has been suggested that the meaning \"free\" was adopted because, after the conquest of Gaul, only Franks were free of taxation, or more generally because they had the status of freemen in contrast to servants or slaves..",
    "Around 125 BC, the south of Gaul was conquered by the Romans, who called this region Provincia Nostra , which over time evolved into the name Provence in French. Julius Caesar conquered the remainder of Gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the Gallic chieftain Vercingetorix in 52 BC..",

    "Subsequently, Christians, who had been persecuted until then, increased rapidly across the entire Roman Empire. But, from the beginning of the 5th century, the Barbarian Invasions resumed. Teutonic tribes invaded the region from present-day Germany, the Visigoths settling in the southwest, the Burgundians along the Rhine River Valley, and the Franks  in the north..",
    "Clovis I was the first Germanic conqueror after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to Catholic Christianity, rather than Arianism; thus France was given the title \"Eldest daughter of the Church\"  by the papacy, and French kings would be called \"the Most Christian Kings of France\" .",

    "French knights made up the bulk of the steady flow of reinforcements throughout the two-hundred-year span of the Crusades, in such a fashion that the Arabs uniformly referred to the crusaders as Franj caring little whether they came from France. The French Crusaders also imported the French language into the Levant, making French the base of the lingua franca (lit.",
    "\"Frankish language\") of the Crusader states. French knights also made up the majority in both the Hospital and the Temple orders.",
    "The latter, in particular, held numerous properties throughout France and by the 13th century were the principal bankers for the French crown, until Philip IV annihilated the order in 1307.",
    "During the reign of Philip of Valois, the French monarchy reached the height of its medieval power. However Philip's seat on the throne was contested by Edward III of England in 1337, and England and France entered the off-and-on Hundred Years' War. The exact boundaries changed greatly with time, but landholdings inside France by the English Kings remained extensive for decades.",

    "The rise of Protestantism in Europe led France to a civil war known as the French Wars of Religion, where, in the most notorious incident, thousands of Huguenots were murdered in the St.",
    "French became the most-used language in diplomacy, science, literature and international affairs, and remained so until the 20th century. During his reign, France took colonial control of many overseas territories in the Americas, Africa and Asia.",
    "In 1685, Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes, forcing thousands of Huguenots into exile and published the Code Noir providing the legal framework for slavery and expelling Jewish people from the French colonies..",
    "An unpopular king, Louis XV's weak rule, his ill-advised financial, political and military decisions – as well as the debauchery of his court– discredited the monarchy, which arguably paved the way for the French Revolution 15 years after his death..",

It is also bordered by Belarus to the north; by Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary to the west; and by Romania and Moldova to the southwest; with a coastline along the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov to the south and southeast. Kyiv is the nation's capital and largest city.",
    "Ukraine's state language is Ukrainian; Russian is also widely spoken, especially in the east and south.",
    "During the Middle Ages, Ukraine was the site of early Slavic expansion and the area later became a key centre of East Slavic culture under the state of Kievan Rus', which emerged in the 9th century.",
    "The Cossack Hetmanate emerged in central Ukraine in the 17th century, but was partitioned between Russia and Poland, and ultimately absorbed by the Russian Empire.",
    "During World War II, Ukraine was devastated by the German occupation.",

However, due to its extensive fertile land, pre-war Ukraine was one of the largest grain exporters in the world. It is a founding member of the United Nations, as well as a member of the Council of Europe, the World Trade Organization, and the OSCE.",
    "The name of Ukraine likely comes from the old Slavic term for \"borderland\", as does the word krajina.",
    "In the English-speaking world during most of the 20th century, Ukraine  was referred to as \"the Ukraine\". This is because the word ukraina means \"borderland\" so the definite article would be natural in the English language; this is similar to \"Nederlanden\", which means \"low lands\" and is rendered in English as \"the Netherlands\". However, since Ukraine's declaration of independence in 1991, this usage has become politicised and is now rarer, and style guides advise against its use. US ambassador William Taylor said that using \"the Ukraine\" implies disregard for Ukrainian sovereignty. The official Ukrainian position is that \"the Ukraine\" is both grammatically and politically incorrect..",
    "Settlement by modern humans in Ukraine and its vicinity dates back to 32,000 BC, with evidence of the Gravettian culture in the Crimean Mountains. By 4,500 BC, the Neolithic Cucuteni–Trypillia culture was flourishing in wide areas of modern Ukraine, including Trypillia and the entire Dnieper-Dniester region.",
    "Ukraine is also considered to be the likely location of the first domestication of the horse. The Kurgan hypothesis places the Volga-Dnieper region of Ukraine and southern Russia as the urheimat of the Proto-Indo-Europeans. Early Indo-European migrations from the Pontic steppes in the 3rd millennium BC spread Yamnaya Steppe pastoralist ancestry and Indo-European languages across large parts of Europe. During the Iron Age, the land was inhabited by Iranian-speaking Cimmerians, Scythians, and Sarmatians. Between 700 BC and 200 BC it was part of the Scythian kingdom..",

According to the Primary Chronicle, the Rus' people initially consisted of Varangians from Scandinavia. In 882, the pagan Prince Oleg  conquered Kyiv from Askold and Dir and proclaimed it as the new capital of the Rus'. Anti-Normanist historians however argue that the East Slavic tribes along the southern parts of the Dnieper River were already in the process of forming a state independently. The Varangian elite, including the ruling Rurik dynasty, later assimilated into the Slavic population. Kievan Rus' was composed of several principalities ruled by the interrelated Rurikid kniazes , who often fought each other for possession of Kyiv..",
    "In 1349, in the aftermath of the Galicia–Volhynia Wars, the area was partitioned between the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. From the mid-13th century to the late 1400s, the Republic of Genoa founded numerous colonies in the Black Sea region of modern Ukraine and transformed these into large commercial centers headed by the consul, a representative of the Republic. In 1430, the region of Podolia was incorporated into Poland, and the lands of modern-day Ukraine became increasingly settled by Poles. In 1441, Genghisid prince Haci I Giray founded the Crimean Khanate on the Crimean Peninsula and the surrounding steppes; the Khanate orchestrated Tatar slave raids and took an estimated two million slaves from the region..",

After the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 1783, the newly acquired lands, now called Novorossiya, were opened up to settlement by Russians. The tsarist autocracy established a policy of Russification, suppressing the use of the Ukrainian language and curtailing the Ukrainian national identity. The western part of present-day Ukraine was subsequently split between Russia and Habsburg-ruled Austria after the fall of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795.",
    "Ukraine joined the Industrial Revolution later than most of Western Europe due to the maintenance of serfdom until 1861. Other than near the newly discovered coal fields of the Donbas, and in some larger cities such as Odesa and Kyiv, Ukraine largely remained an agricultural and resource extraction economy. The Austrian part of Ukraine was particularly destitute, which forced hundreds of thousands of peasants into emigration, who created the backbone of an extensive Ukrainian diaspora in countries such as Canada, the United States and Brazil. Some of the Ukrainians settled in the Far East, too.",

    "indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two types of modern mango cultivars: the \"Indian type\" and the \"Southeast Asian type\". Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that are also called \"mangoes\", the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion..",
    "Worldwide, there are several hundred cultivars of mango.",
    "Depending on the cultivar, mango fruit varies in size, shape, sweetness, skin color, and flesh color, which may be pale yellow, gold, green, or orange. Mango is the national fruit of India, Pakistan and the Philippines, while the mango tree is the national tree of Bangladesh..",
    "The English word mango  originated in the 16th century from the Portuguese word, manga, from the Malay mangga, and ultimately from the Tamil man  + kay . The scientific name, Mangifera indica, refers to a plant bearing mangoes in India..",
    "Mango trees grow to 30–40 metres  tall, with a crown radius of 10–15 m .",
    "In deep soil, the taproot descends to a depth of 6 m , with profuse, wide-spreading feeder roots and anchor roots penetrating deeply into the soil. The leaves are evergreen, alternate, simple, 15–35 centimetres  long, and 6–16 cm  broad; when the leaves are young they are orange-pink, rapidly changing to a dark, glossy red, then dark green as they mature. The flowers are produced in terminal panicles 10–40 cm  long; each flower is small and white with five petals 5–10 millimetres  long, with a mild, sweet fragrance. Over 500 varieties of mangoes are known, many of which ripen in summer, while some give a double crop. The fruit takes four to five months from flowering to ripening..",
    "Ripe intact mangoes give off a distinctive resinous, sweet smell. Inside the pit 1–2 mm  thick is a thin lining covering a single seed, 4–7 cm  long.",
    "Mangoes have recalcitrant seeds which do not survive freezing and drying. Mango trees grow readily from seeds, with germination success highest when seeds are obtained from mature fruits..",
    "Mangoes originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. The mango is considered an evolutionary anachronism, whereby seed dispersal was once accomplished by a now-extinct evolutionary forager, such as a megafauna mammal..",
    "From their center of origin, mangoes diverged into two genetically distinct populations: the subtropical Indian group and the tropical Southeast Asian group.",
    "It was previously believed that mangoes originated from a single domestication event in South Asia before being spread to Southeast Asia, but a 2019 study found no evidence of a center of diversity in India.",
    "Instead, it identified a higher unique genetic diversity in Southeast Asian cultivars than in Indian cultivars, indicating that mangoes may have originally been domesticated first in Southeast Asia before being introduced to South Asia.",
    "However, the authors also cautioned that the diversity in Southeast Asian mangoes might be the result of other reasons .",
    "Nevertheless, the existence of two distinct genetic populations also identified by the study indicates that the domestication of the mango is more complex than previously assumed and would at least indicate multiple domestication events in Southeast Asia and South Asia..",
    "There are many hundreds of named mango cultivars.",
    "In mango orchards, several cultivars are often grown to improve pollination.",
    "A common monoembryonic cultivar is 'Alphonso', an important export product, considered \"the king of mangoes.\".",
    "Asian mangoes are resistant to anthracnose..",
    "Generally, ripe mangoes have an orange-yellow or reddish peel and are juicy for eating, while exported fruit are often picked while underripe with green peels.",
    "Although producing ethylene while ripening, unripened exported mangoes do not have the same juiciness or flavor as fresh fruit.",
    "From tropical Asia, mangoes were introduced to East Africa by Arab and Persian traders in the ninth to tenth centuries. The 14th-century Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta reported it at Mogadishu. It was spread further into other areas around the world during the Colonial Era.",
    "The Portuguese Empire spread the mango from their colony in Goa to East and West Africa.",
    "The Spanish Empire also introduced mangoes directly from the Philippines to western Mexico via the Manila galleons from at least the 16th century.",
    "Mangoes were only introduced to Florida by 1833..",
    "The mango is now cultivated in most frost-free tropical and warmer subtropical climates.",
    "It is cultivated extensively in South Asia, Southeast Asia, East and West Africa, the tropical and subtropical Americas, and the Caribbean. Mangoes are also grown in Andalusia, Spain , as its coastal subtropical climate is one of the few places in mainland Europe that permits the growth of tropical plants and fruit trees.",
    "Many commercial cultivars are grafted onto the cold-hardy rootstock of the Gomera-1 mango cultivar, originally from Cuba.",
    "Its root system is well adapted to a coastal Mediterranean climate. Many of the 1,000+ mango cultivars are easily cultivated using grafted saplings, ranging from the \"turpentine mango\"  to the Bullock's Heart.",
    "A wide variety of diseases can afflict mangoes.."

Another Medieval Latin name for Rus' was Ruthenia..",

Early Indo-European migrations from the Pontic–Caspian steppe of Ukraine and Russia spread Yamnaya ancestry and Indo-European languages across large parts of Eurasia. Nomadic pastoralism developed in the Pontic–Caspian steppe beginning in the Chalcolithic. Remnants of these steppe civilizations were discovered in places such as Ipatovo, Sintashta, Arkaim, and Pazyryk, which bear the earliest known traces of horses in warfare. The genetic makeup of speakers of the Uralic language family in northern Europe was shaped by migration from Siberia that began at least 3,500 years ago. In classical antiquity, the Pontic-Caspian Steppe was known as Scythia. In late 8th century BCE, Ancient Greek traders brought classical civilization to the trade emporiums in Tanais and Phanagoria..",

The Khazars, who were of Turkic origin, ruled the steppes between the Caucasus in the south, to the east past the Volga river basin, and west as far as Kyiv on the Dnieper river until the 10th century. After them came the Pechenegs who created a large confederacy, which was subsequently taken over by the Cumans and the Kipchaks..",

The invaders, later known as Tatars, formed the state of the Golden Horde, which ruled over Russia for the next two centuries. Only the Novgorod Republic escaped Mongol occupation after it agreed to pay tribute. Galicia-Volhynia would later be absorbed by Lithuania and Poland, while the Novgorod Republic continued to prosper in the north.",

When the seat of the Metropolitan of the Russian Orthodox Church moved to Moscow in 1325, its influence increased. Moscow's last rival, the Novgorod Republic, prospered as the chief fur trade centre and the easternmost port of the Hanseatic League..",
    "Led by Prince Dmitry Donskoy of Moscow, the united army of Russian principalities inflicted a milestone defeat on the Mongol-Tatars in the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380. Moscow gradually absorbed its parent duchy and surrounding principalities, including formerly strong rivals such as Tver and Novgorod..",

    "Dream interpretation, practiced by the Babylonians in the third millennium BCE and even earlier by the ancient Sumerians, figures prominently in religious texts in several traditions, and has played a lead role in psychotherapy. The scientific study of dreams is called oneirology. Most modern dream study focuses on the neurophysiology of dreams and on proposing and testing hypotheses regarding dream function.",
    "It is not known where in the brain dreams originate, if there is a single origin for dreams or if multiple regions of the brain are involved, or what the purpose of dreaming is for the body or mind.",
    "The human dream experience and what to make of it has undergone sizable shifts over the course of history. Long ago, according to writings from Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt, dreams dictated post-dream behaviors to an extent sharply reduced in later millennia.",
    "These ancient writings about dreams highlight visitation dreams, where a dream figure, usually a deity or a prominent forebear, commands the dreamer to take specific actions and may predict future events. Framing the dream experience varies across cultures as well as through time.",
    "Dreams occur mainly in the rapid-eye movement  stage of sleep—when brain activity is high and resembles that of being awake.",
    "Because REM sleep is detectable in many species, and because research suggests that all mammals experience REM, linking dreams to REM sleep has led to conjectures that animals dream.",
    "In visitation dreams reported in ancient writings, dreamers were largely passive in their dreams, and visual content served primarily to frame authoritative auditory messaging. Gudea, the king of the Sumerian city-state of Lagash (reigned c.",
    "2144–2124 BCE), rebuilt the temple of Ningirsu as the result of a dream in which he was told to do so. After antiquity, the passive hearing of visitation dreams largely gave way to visualized narratives in which the dreamer becomes a character who actively participates.",
    "In 1966, Hall and Robert Van de Castle published The Content Analysis of Dreams, in which they outlined a coding system to study 1,000 dream reports from college students. Results indicated that participants from varying parts of the world demonstrated similarity in their dream content.",

    "Negative emotions were much more common than positive ones. The Hall data analysis showed that sexual dreams occur no more than 10% of the time and are more prevalent in young to mid-teens. Another study showed that 8% of both men's and women's dreams have sexual content. In some cases, sexual dreams may result in orgasms or nocturnal emissions.",

    "People who are blind from birth do not have visual dreams.",

    "Studies detect an increase of blood flow in a specific brain region and then credit that region with a role in generating dreams.",
    "Image creation in the brain involves significant neural activity downstream from eye intake, and it is theorized that \"the visual imagery of dreams is produced by activation during sleep of the same structures that generate complex visual imagery in waking perception.\".",
    "Dreams present a running narrative rather than exclusively visual imagery.",
    "For humans in the pre-classical era, and continuing for some non-literate populations into modern times, dreams are believed to have functioned as revealers of truths sourced during sleep from gods or other external entities. Ancient Egyptians believed that dreams were the best way to receive divine revelation, and thus they would induce  dreams.",
    "They went to sanctuaries and slept on special \"dream beds\" in hope of receiving advice, comfort, or healing from the gods. From a Darwinian perspective dreams would have to fulfill some kind of biological requirement, provide some benefit for natural selection to take place, or at least have no negative impact on fitness.",
    "Robert , a physician from Hamburg, was the first who suggested that dreams are a need and that they have the function to erase  sensory impressions that were not fully worked up, and  ideas that were not fully developed during the day.",
    "In dreams, incomplete material is either removed  or deepened and included into memory.",
    "Freud, whose dream studies focused on interpreting dreams, not explaining how or why humans dream, disputed Robert's hypothesis and proposed that dreams preserve sleep by representing as fulfilled those wishes that otherwise would awaken the dreamer. Freud wrote that dreams \"serve the purpose of prolonging sleep instead of waking up.",
    "Dreams are the GUARDIANS of sleep and not its disturbers.\".",
    "A turning point in theorizing about dream function came in 1953, when Science published the Aserinsky and Kleitman paper establishing REM sleep as a distinct phase of sleep and linking dreams to REM sleep. Until and even after publication of the Solms 2000 paper that certified the separability of REM sleep and dream phenomena, many studies purporting to uncover the function of dreams have in fact been studying not dreams but measurable REM sleep.",

The heavy metal guitar sound comes from a combined use of high volumes and heavy fuzz. For classic heavy metal guitar tone, guitarists maintain gain at moderate levels, without excessive preamp or pedal distortion, to retain open spaces and air in the music; the guitar amplifier is turned up loud to produce the \"punch and grind\" characteristic. Thrash metal guitar tone has scooped mid-frequencies and tightly compressed sound with multiple bass frequencies. Guitar solos are \"an essential element of the heavy metal code ..",

Heavy metal \"demands the subordination of the voice\" to the overall sound of the band.",
    "The bass provides the low-end sound crucial to making the music \"heavy\". The bass plays a \"more important role in heavy metal than in any other genre of rock\". Metal basslines vary widely in complexity, from holding down a low pedal point as a foundation to doubling complex riffs and licks along with the lead or rhythm guitars.",
    "Some bands feature the bass as a lead instrument, an approach popularized by Metallica's Cliff Burton with his heavy emphasis on bass ‍solos and use of chords while playing the ‍bass in the early 1980s. Lemmy of Motörhead often played overdriven power chords in his bass lines..",
    "The essence of heavy metal drumming is creating a loud, constant beat for the band using the \"trifecta of speed, power, and precision\". Heavy metal drumming \"requires an exceptional amount of endurance\", and drummers have to develop \"considerable speed, coordination, and dexterity ..",
    "to play the intricate patterns\" used in heavy metal. A characteristic metal drumming technique is the cymbal choke, which consists of striking a cymbal and then immediately silencing it by grabbing it with the other hand , producing a burst of sound.",
    "In live performance, loudness – an \"onslaught of sound\", in sociologist Deena Weinstein's description – is considered vital. In his book, Metalheads, psychologist Jeffrey Arnett refers to heavy metal concerts as \"the sensory equivalent of war\". Following the lead set by Jimi Hendrix, Cream and the Who, early heavy metal acts such as Blue Cheer set new benchmarks for volume.",
    "Heavy metal performers tended to be almost exclusively male until at least the mid-1980s, with some exceptions such as Girlschool. However, by the 2010s, women were making more of an impact, and PopMatters' Craig Hayes argues that metal \"clearly empowers women\". In the power metal and symphonic metal subgenres, there has been a sizable number of bands that have had women as the lead singers, such as Nightwish, Delain and Within Temptation.",
    "Weinstein observes that the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the \"rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency\". In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two- or three-note rhythmic figures – generally made up of eighth or 16th notes.",
    "Heavy metal songs also use longer rhythmic figures such as whole note- or dotted quarter note-length chords in slow-tempo power ballads.",
    "The tempos in early heavy metal music tended to be \"slow, even ponderous\". By the late 1970s, however, metal bands were employing a wide variety of tempos, and as recently as the 2000s, metal tempos range from slow ballad tempos  to extremely fast blast beat tempos ..",
    "Heavy metal is usually based on riffs created with three main harmonic traits: modal scale progressions, tritone and chromatic progressions, and the use of pedal points.",
    "Traditional heavy metal tends to employ modal scales, in particular the Aeolian and Phrygian modes. Harmonically speaking, this means the genre typically incorporates modal chord progressions such as the Aeolian progressions I-♭VI-♭VII, I-♭VII-, or I-♭VI-IV-♭VII and Phrygian progressions implying the relation between I and ♭II .",
    "Tense-sounding chromatic or tritone relationships are used in a number of metal chord progressions. In addition to using modal harmonic relationships, heavy metal also uses \"pentatonic and blues-derived features\"..",
    "Heavy metal songs often make extensive use of pedal point as a harmonic basis.",
    "A pedal point is a sustained tone, typically in the bass range, during which at least one foreign  harmony is sounded in the other parts. According to Robert Walser, heavy metal harmonic relationships are \"often quite complex\" and the harmonic analysis done by metal players and teachers is \"often very sophisticated\". In the study of heavy metal chord structures, it has been concluded that \"heavy metal music has proved to be far more complicated\" than other music researchers had realized..",
    "as 'classical music'\" has been a major influence on heavy metal since the genre's earliest days, and that metal's \"most influential musicians have been guitar players who have also studied classical music."

  "dance": [
    "Dance is a sport form consisting of sequences of movement with aesthetic and often symbolic value, either improvised or purposefully selected. Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin..",
    "An important distinction is to be drawn between the contexts of theatrical and participatory dance, although these two categories are not always completely separate; both may have special functions, whether social, ceremonial, competitive, erotic, martial, or sacred/liturgical.",
    "Other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance-like quality, including martial arts, gymnastics, cheerleading, figure skating, synchronized swimming, marching bands, and many other forms of athletics.",
    "Dance is not solely restricted to performance, though, as dance is used as a form of exercise and occasionally training for other sports and activities.",
    "Dance itself has also become a sport for some, with dancing competitions found across the world exhibiting various different styles and standards.",
    "Dance requires an equal amount of cognitive focus as well as physical strength.",
    "Dance is considered to be a very aesthetically pleasing art-form..",
    "Theatrical dance, also called performance or concert dance, is intended primarily as a spectacle, usually a performance upon a stage by virtuoso dancers.",
    "Examples are western ballet and modern dance, Classical Indian dance such as Bharatanatyam and Chinese and Japanese song and dance dramas such as dragon dance.",
    "Most classical forms are centred upon dance alone, but performance dance may also appear in opera and other forms of musical theatre..",
    "Participatory dance, on the other hand, whether it be a folk dance, a social dance, a group dance such as a line, circle, chain or square dance, or a partner dance such as is common in Western ballroom dancing, is undertaken primarily for a common purpose, such as social interaction or exercise, or building flexibility of participants rather than to serve any benefit to onlookers.",
    "Such dance seldom has any narrative.",
    "A group dance and a corps de ballet, a social partner dance and a pas de deux, differ profoundly.",
    "Even a solo dance may be undertaken solely for the satisfaction of the dancer.",
    "Participatory dancers often all employ the same movements and steps but, for example, in the rave culture of electronic dance music, vast crowds may engage in free dance, uncoordinated with those around them.",
    "On the other hand, some cultures lay down strict rules as to the particular dances in which, for example, men, women, and children may or must participate.",
    "Archaeological evidence for early dance includes 10,000-year-old paintings in Madhya Pradesh, India at the Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka, and Egyptian tomb paintings depicting dancing figures, dated c.",
    "It has been proposed that before the invention of written languages, dance was an important part of the oral and performance methods of passing stories down from one generation to the next. The use of dance in ecstatic trance states and healing rituals  is thought to have been another early factor in the social development of dance..",
    "References to dance can be found in very early recorded history; Greek dance  is referred to by Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch and Lucian. The Bible and Talmud refer to many events related to dance, and contain over 30 different dance terms. In Chinese pottery as early as the Neolithic period, groups of people are depicted dancing in a line holding hands, and the earliest Chinese word for \"dance\" is found written in the oracle bones. Dance is further described in the Lüshi Chunqiu. Primitive dance in ancient China was associated with sorcery and shamanic rituals..",
    "It mainly deals with drama, in which dance plays an important part in Indian culture.",
    "It categorizes dance into four types--secular, ritual, abstract, and, interpretive--and into four regional varieties.",
    "A strong continuous tradition of dance has since continued in India, through to modern times, where it continues to play a role in culture, ritual, and, notably, the Bollywood entertainment industry.",
    "Many other contemporary dance forms can likewise be traced back to historical, traditional, ceremonial, and ethnic dance.",
    "Dance is generally, however not exclusively, performed with the accompaniment of music and may or may not be performed in time to such music.",
    "Some dance  may provide its own audible accompaniment in place of  music.",
    "Many early forms of music and dance were created for each other and are frequently performed together.",
    "Notable examples of traditional dance/music couplings include the jig, waltz, tango, disco, and salsa.",
    "Some musical genres have a parallel dance form such as baroque music and baroque dance; other varieties of dance and music may share nomenclature but developed separately, such as classical music and classical ballet.",
    "The choreography and music go hand in hand, as they complement each other to express a story told by the choreographer and or dancers..",
    "Rhythm and dance are deeply linked in history and practice."

  "looking": [
    "Looking is the act of intentionally focusing visual perception on someone or something, for the purpose of obtaining information, and possibly to convey interest or another sentiment.",
    "A large number of troponyms exist to describe variations of looking at things, with prominent examples including the verbs \"stare, gaze, gape, gawp, gawk, goggle, glare, glimpse, glance, peek, peep, peer, squint, leer, gloat, and ogle\". Additional terms with nuanced meanings include viewing, watching, eyeing, observing, beholding, and scanning. Looking is both a physical act of directing the focus of the eyes, and a psychological act of interpreting what is seen and choosing whether to continue looking at it, or to look elsewhere.",
    "Where more than one person is involved, looking may lead to eye contact between those doing the looking, which raises further implications for the relationship established through that act.",
    "\"Looking\" and \"seeing\" are traditionally contrasted in a number of ways, although their usage often overlaps.",
    "Looking can be characterized as \"the action precedent to seeing\". Any kind of looking or viewing actually implies \"seeing\" certain things within the range of view, while not \"seeing\" others, because they are unimportant at the moment.",
    "Thus, things that are within the range of view, but which are unimportant to the viewer, may be treated by the brain as if they are transparent, by being looked over, past, and around. The distinction between \"looking\" and \"seeing\" has been compared to the distinction between hearing and listening, with one being a rote activity and the other requiring a conscious and thoughtful effort to understand what is being seen or heard. Because of the breadth and flexibility of both words, different authors may reverse the relationship in contrasting them, with one suggesting that a person can \"look at\" something without truly \"seeing\" it, while another might suggest that a person might be \"seeing\" something, but not truly \"look at\" it. Both arrangements suggest that the person is directing their vision towards the thing, but failing to give sufficient attention to notice specific characteristics or implications of what is in the visual field.",
    "A number of troponyms exist to illustrate kinds of looking that are either intentionally or unconsciously done in intense, pronounced, or prolonged ways.",
    "\"Staring\" is an intense form of looking in which the eyes of the person looking remain fixed on the subject for an extended period, and is generally considered rude. \"Gazing\" has historically implied intensity, but not aggressiveness, and may imply \"wonder, fascination, awe, or admiration\". In the twentieth century, however, sociologists began to use the term to suggest a power relationship between the person who is gazing and the subject of the gaze, with the former exercising an ability to define the latter. By contrast, glaring does suggest aggressiveness and confrontation. \"Eyeing\" implies looking at something with some feeling involved, such as desire or wariness..",
    "\"Observing\" implies looking at a specific object or area for a prolonged period specifically for purposes of observation, with the purpose of looking specifically being to obtain information about the thing being observed without necessarily either judging it or interfering with it. \"Watching\" implies a similar prolonged focus, but can also imply looking at something in a distracted or absentminded manner, such as watching television..",
    "\"Gaping\" and \"gawking\" also indicate prolonged acts of looking, but suggest that the person doing the looking is so mentally distracted by the subject being observed that they become unaware of their own conduct.",
    "A number of troponyms exist to illustrate kinds of looking that are either intentionally or unconsciously done in a quick, subtle, or hidden way.",
    "\"Glancing\" and \"glimpsing\" are terms that imply looking at things in a subtle way, or seeing things very briefly before they move out of the range of vision.",
    "Although the two are often confused, a glance is more commonly a quick movement of the eye, whereas a glimpse is more often a result of the object being watched quickly moving out of sight. \"Scanning\" suggests quickly looking over an area \"to get a general impression\", accomplished \"by rapidly noting one point after another\". Glance appeared as a word prior to 1450, from Old French glacer or glacier, a reference to the quick movement of slipping on ice, and was first recorded as appearing with its current meaning in 1582. Glimpse appeared as a noun with its current meaning in 1580, from Middle English glimsen, and as a verb in 1779, although it was originally associated with seeing bright or shiny things.

  "informed": [
    "Informed consent is a principle in medical ethics and medical law and media studies, that a patient must have sufficient information and understanding before making decisions about their medical care.",
    "In most systems, healthcare providers have a legal and ethical responsibility to ensure that a patient's consent is informed.",
    "Within the US, definitions of informed consent vary, and the standard required is generally determined by the state. Informed consent requires a clear appreciation and understanding of the facts, implications, and consequences of an action.",
    "To give informed consent, the individual concerned must have adequate reasoning faculties and possess all relevant facts.",
    "Impairments to reasoning and judgment that may preclude informed consent include intellectual or emotional immaturity, high levels of stress such as post-traumatic stress disorder or a severe intellectual disability, severe mental disorder, intoxication, severe sleep deprivation, dementia, or coma.",
    "Obtaining informed consent is not always required.",
    "If an individual is considered unable to give informed consent, another person is generally authorized to give consent on their behalf—for example, the parents or legal guardians of a child  and conservators for the mentally disordered.",
    "Informed consent is codified in both national and international law.",
    "Informed consent can be complex to evaluate, because neither expressions of consent, nor expressions of understanding of implications, necessarily mean that full adult consent was in fact given, nor that full comprehension of relevant issues is internally digested. Consent may be implied within the usual subtleties of human communication, rather than explicitly negotiated verbally or in writing.",
    "There are also structured instruments for evaluating capacity to give informed consent, although no ideal instrument presently exists..",
    "Thus, there is always a degree to which informed consent must be assumed or inferred based upon observation, or knowledge, or legal reliance.",
    "For an individual to give valid informed consent, three components must be present: disclosure, capacity and voluntariness..",
    "As children often lack the decision-making ability or legal power  to provide true informed consent for medical decisions, it often falls on parents or legal guardians to provide informed permission for medical decisions.",
    "When addressing the issue of informed consent with children, the primary response is parental consent.",
    "According to 10 USC 980, the United States Code for the Armed Forces, Limitations on the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects, a waiver of advanced informed consent may be granted by the Secretary of Defense if a research project would:.",
    "While informed consent is a basic right and should be carried out effectively, if a patient is incapacitated due to injury or illness, it is still important that patients benefit from emergency experimentation. The Food and Drug Administration  and the Department of Health and Human Services  joined to create federal guidelines to permit emergency research, without informed consent. However, they can only proceed with the research if they obtain a waiver of informed consent  or an emergency exception from informed consent ..",
    "The 21st Century Cures Act enacted by the 114th United States Congress in December 2016 allows researchers to waive the requirement for informed consent when clinical testing \"poses no more than minimal risk\" and \"includes appropriate safeguards to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of the human subject.\".",
    "Medical sociologists have studied informed consent as well bioethics more generally.",
    "Oonagh Corrigan, looking at informed consent for research in patients, argues that much of the conceptualization of informed consent comes from research ethics and bioethics with a focus on patient autonomy, and notes that this aligns with a neoliberal worldview.: 770  Corrigan argues that a model based solely around individual decision making does not accurately describe the reality of consent because of social processes: a view that has started to be acknowledged in bioethics.: 771  She feels that the liberal principles of informed consent are often in opposition with autocratic medical practices such that norms values and systems of expertise often shape and individuals ability to apply choice.: 789.",
    "The doctrine of informed consent relates to professional negligence and establishes a breach of the duty of care owed to the patient .",
    "The doctrine of informed consent also has significant implications for medical trials of medications, devices, or procedures.",
    "Until 2015 in the United Kingdom and in countries such as Malaysia and Singapore, informed consent in medical procedures requires proof as to the standard of care to expect as a recognised standard of acceptable professional practice , that is, what risks would a medical professional usually disclose in the circumstances .",
    "Arguably, this is \"sufficient consent\" rather than \"informed consent.\" The UK has since departed from the Bolam test for judging standards of informed consent, due to the landmark ruling in Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board.",
    "Medicine in the United States, Australia, and Canada takes this patient-centric approach to \"informed consent.\" Informed consent in these jurisdictions requires healthcare providers to disclose significant risks, as well as risks of particular importance to that patient.",
    "The doctrine of informed consent should be contrasted with the general doctrine of medical consent, which applies to assault or battery.",
    "As the higher standard of informed consent applies to negligence, not battery, the other elements of negligence must be made out.",
    "Optimal establishment of an informed consent requires adaptation to cultural or other individual factors of the patient.",
    "The informed consent doctrine is generally implemented through good healthcare practice: pre-operation discussions with patients and the use of medical consent forms in hospitals.",

    "It is related to Modern German Weib , and Danish viv ; The original meaning of the phrase \"wife\" as simply \"woman\", unconnected with marriage or a husband/wife, is preserved in words such as \"midwife\", \"goodwife\", \"fishwife\" and \"spaewife\".",
    "A woman on her wedding day is usually described as a bride, even after the wedding ceremony while being described as a wife is also appropriate after the wedding or after the honeymoon.",
    "g., by Roman Catholic ritual, the word bride actually means fiancée and applies up to the exchange of matrimonial consent ; from then on, even while the rest of the very ceremony is ongoing, the woman is a wife, and no longer a bride, and the bridal couple is no longer referred to as such but as the newlywed couple or \"newlyweds\".",
    "\"Wife\" refers to the institutionalized relation to the other spouse, unlike mother, a term that puts a woman into the context of her children.",
    "The term wife is most commonly applied to a woman in a union sanctioned by law , not to a woman in an informal cohabitation relationship, which may be known as a girlfriend, partner, cohabitant, significant other, concubine, mistress, etc.",
    "However, a woman in a so-called common law marriage may describe herself as a common law wife, de facto wife, or simply a wife.",
    "Those seeking to advance gender neutrality may refer to both marriage partners as \"spouses\", and many countries and societies are rewording their statute law by replacing \"wife\" and \"husband\" with \"spouse\".",
    "A former wife whose spouse is deceased is a widow.",
    "The status of a wife may be terminated by divorce, annulment, or the death of a spouse.",
    "In the case of divorce, terminology such as former-wife or ex-wife is often used.",
    "The social status of such women varies by culture, but in some places, they may be subject to potentially harmful practices, such as widow inheritance or levirate marriage; or divorced women may be socially stigmatized. In some cultures, the termination of the status of wife made life itself meaningless, as in the case of those cultures that practiced sati, a funeral ritual within some Asian communities, in which a recently widowed woman committed suicide by fire, typically on the husband's funeral pyre.",
    "The legal rights of a wife have been since the 19th century, and still are, in many jurisdictions subject to debate.",
    "In various marriage laws around the world, however, the husband continues to have authority; for instance, the Civil Code of Iran states at Article 1105: \"In relations between husband and wife; the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband\"..",
    "Traditionally, and still in some parts of the world, the bride or her family bring her husband a dowry, or the husband or his family pay a bride price to the bride's family, or both are exchanged between the families; or the husband pays the wife a dower.",
    "In some cultures, it was paid not only to support the establishment of a new family, but also served as a condition that if the husband committed grave offenses upon his wife, the dowry had to be returned to the wife or her family; but during the marriage, the dowry was often made inalienable by the husband. Today, dowries continue to be expected in parts of South Asia such as India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, and conflicts related to their payment sometimes result in violence such as dowry deaths and bride burning.",
    "Traditionally, and still in many cultures, the role of a wife was closely tied to that of a mother, by a strong expectation that a wife ought to bear children, while, conversely, an unmarried woman should not have a child out of wedlock.",
    "Christian cultures claim to be guided by the New Testament in regard to their view on the position of a wife in society as well as her marriage.",
    "The New Testament condemns divorce for both men and women  and assumes monogamy on the part of the husband: the wife is to have her \"own\" husband, and the husband is to have his \"own\" wife .",
    "In the medieval period, this was understood to mean that a wife should not share a husband with other wives.",
    "As a result, divorce was relatively uncommon in the pre-modern West, particularly in the medieval and early modern period, and husbands in the Roman, later medieval and early modern period did not publicly take more than one wife.",
    "Because wives' property rights and daughters' inheritance rights varied widely from region to region due to differing legal systems, the amount of property a wife might own varied greatly.",
    "Under English common law, there was a system where a wife with a living husband  could own little property in her own name. Unable to easily support herself, marriage was very important to most women's economic status.",
    "This problem has been dealt with extensively in literature, where the most important reason for women's limited power was the denial of equal education and equal property rights for females. The situation was assessed by the English conservative moralist Sir William Blackstone: \"The husband and wife are one, and the husband is the one.\" Married women's property rights in the English-speaking world improved with the Married Women's Property Act 1882 and similar legal changes, which allowed wives with living husbands to own property in their own names.",
    "Until late in the 20th century, women could in some regions or times sue a man for wreath money when he took her virginity without taking her as his wife..",
    "If a woman did not want to marry, another option was entering a convent as a nun. to become a \"bride of Christ\", a state in which her chastity and economic survival would be protected. Both a wife and a nun wore Christian headcovering, which proclaimed their state of protection by the rights of marriage. Much more significant than the option of becoming a nun, was the option of non-religious spinsterhood in the West."

    "Historically, krone coins have been minted in Denmark since the 17th century.",
    "One krone is subdivided into 100 øre , the name øre is probably derived from the Latin word for gold. Altogether there are eleven denominations of the krone, with the smallest being the 50 øre coin .",
    "The krone is pegged to the euro via the ERM II, the European Union's exchange rate mechanism.",

    "The parties to the union were the three Scandinavian countries, where the name was krone in Denmark and Norway and krona in Sweden, a word which in all three languages literally means ‘crown’.",
    "The three currencies were on the gold standard, with the krone/krona defined as 1⁄2480 of a kilogram of pure gold..",
    "Between 1940 and 1945, the krone was tied to the German Reichsmark.",
    "Following the end of the German occupation, a rate of 24 kroner to the British pound was introduced, reduced to 19.34  in August the same year.",

    "In 2014, it was decided to stop printing of the krone in Denmark, but the work would be outsourced, and on 20 December 2016, the last notes were printed by the National Bank..",
    "Denmark has not introduced the euro, following a rejection by referendum in 2000, but the Danish krone is pegged closely to the euro  in ERM II, the EU's exchange rate mechanism.",
    "The Faroe Islands uses a localized, non-independent version of the Danish krone, known as the Faroese króna pegged with the Danish krone at par, using the Danish coin series, but have their own series of distinct banknotes, first being issued in the 1950s and later modernized in the 1970s and the 2000s.",
    "Still, Greenland continues to use Danish kroner as sole official currency.",
    "Historically, Greenland under the colonial administration issued distinct banknotes between 1803 and 1968, together with coins between 1926 and 1964 .",
    "The 50 øre coins are thus minted from copper-coloured bronze, the 1, 2 and 5 krone coins from a silver-coloured cupronickel alloy, and the 10 and 20 krone coins from golden aluminium bronze.",

    "The rims of the 2 and 20 krone coins have interrupted milling.",

    "The first series, 20-krone coins featuring towers in Denmark, ran between 2002 and 2007 and spawned ten different motifs.",
    "A second series of 20-krone coins, starting in 2007 with twelve different planned motifs and ten already released by November 2011, shows Denmark as a maritime nation in the world, featuring iconic Danish, Faroese and Greenlandic ships and like the previous series of tower coins, the series reflect various landmarks in shipbuilding in the three countries.",

Although it is useful as a heuristic in developing models of reaction mechanisms, it has been shown to fail as a criterion for selecting among some selected published models.

    "The Bihar plain is split by the river Ganges, which flows from west to east..",
    "On 15 November 2000, southern Bihar was ceded to form the new state of Jharkhand. Only 20% of the population of Bihar lives in urban areas as of 2021. Additionally, almost 58% of Biharis are below the age of 25, giving Bihar the highest proportion of young people of any Indian state. The official language is Hindi and additional language is Urdu, although other languages are common, including Maithili, Magahi, Bhojpuri, and other Languages of Bihar.",
    "In Ancient and Classical India, the area that is now Bihar was considered the centre of political and cultural power and as a haven of learning. From Magadha arose India's first empire, the Maurya empire, as well as one of the world's most widely adhered-to religions: Buddhism. Magadha empires, notably under the Maurya and Gupta dynasties, unified large parts of South Asia under a central rule. Another region of Bihar, Mithila, was an early centre of learning and the centre of the Videha kingdom..",
    "However, since the late 1970s, Bihar has lagged far behind other Indian states in terms of social and economic development. Many economists and social scientists claim that this is a direct result of the policies of the central government, such as the freight equalisation policy, its apathy towards Bihar, lack of Bihari sub-nationalism, and the Permanent Settlement of 1793 by the British East India Company. The state government has, however, made significant strides in developing the state. Improved governance has led to an economic revival in the state through increased investment in infrastructure, better healthcare facilities, greater emphasis on education, and a reduction in crime and corruption..",

    "Jha suggests, instead, that these incidents were the result of Buddhist–Brahmin skirmishes in a fight for supremacy. After the fall of the Pala Empire, the Chero dynasty ruled some parts of Bihar from the 12th century until Mughal rule in the 16th century. In 1540, the great Pathan chieftain, Sher Shah Suri, took northern India from the Mughals and declared Delhi his capital.",

    "The relationship was deteriorating badly—Bolan barely tolerated Took's drug use, and Steve Mann recalled that it was clear they \"cordially detested each other\"..",
    "In addition, Took's friendship with Bolan's idol Syd Barrett had also developed through their shared interests in both LSD and \"strange musical noises\".",

    "Eventually, Took donated two of his songs—\"Three Little Piggies\" and \"The Sparrow Is A Sign\"—to former Tomorrow and Pretty Things drummer Twink's 1969 solo album, Think Pink. Consequently, before the first Tyrannosaurus Rex tour of America, Bolan and his management gave Took notice that they would be sacking him once the tour was complete.",
    "Took had already earned himself the nickname \"The Phantom Spiker\"  through previous similar pranks. Bolan was severely affected by the spiked drink and considered Took to be the prime suspect..",
    "Took was contractually obliged to go on the US tour, but his heart was not in it and he attempted to cope through taking drugs.",
    "To counter this, he drew from the shock rock style of Iggy Pop; as Took explained to the NME in 1972 \"I took my shirt off in the Sunset Strip where we were playing and whipped myself till everybody shut up.",
    "'What's going on, man, there's some nutter attacking himself on stage.' I mean, Iggy Stooge had the same basic approach.\" This allowed the management to claim subsequently that it was Took's behaviour on stage which had caused the sacking.",
    "Bolan replaced Took with Mickey Finn, and after one further album renamed the duo T.",
    "After being sacked by Bolan, Took formed a prototype version of the Pink Fairies with Twink and Mick Farren, recently ousted from his own band, the Deviants."

  "predict": [
    "Predictor may refer to:.",
    "A prediction , or forecast, is a statement about a future event or data.",
    "Prediction can be useful to assist in making plans about possible developments.",
    "In a non-statistical sense, the term \"prediction\" is often used to refer to an informed guess or opinion.",
    "A prediction of this kind might be informed by a predicting person's abductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, deductive reasoning, and experience; and may be useful—if the predicting person is a knowledgeable person in the field..",
    "The Delphi method is a technique for eliciting such expert-judgement-based predictions in a controlled way.",
    "This type of prediction might be perceived as consistent with statistical techniques in the sense that, at minimum, the \"data\" being used is the predicting expert's cognitive experiences forming an intuitive \"probability curve.\".",
    "In statistics, prediction is a part of statistical inference.",
    "One particular approach to such inference is known as predictive inference, but the prediction can be undertaken within any of the several approaches to statistical inference.",
    "Indeed, one possible description of statistics is that it provides a means of transferring knowledge about a sample of a population to the whole population, and to other related populations, which is not necessarily the same as prediction over time.",
    "When information is transferred across time, often to specific points in time, the process is known as forecasting. Forecasting usually requires time series methods, while prediction is often performed on cross-sectional data.",
    "Statistical techniques used for prediction include regression analysis and its various sub-categories such as linear regression, generalized linear models , etc.",
    "When these and/or related, generalized set of regression or machine learning methods are deployed in commercial usage, the field is known as predictive analytics..",
    "If models can be expressed as transfer functions or in terms of state-space parameters then smoothed, filtered and predicted data estimates can be calculated. If the underlying generating models are linear then a minimum-variance Kalman filter and a minimum-variance smoother may be used to recover data of interest from noisy measurements.",
    "These techniques rely on one-step-ahead predictors .",
    "To use regression analysis for prediction, data are collected on the variable that is to be predicted, called the dependent variable or response variable, and on one or more variables whose values are hypothesized to influence it, called independent variables or explanatory variables.",
    "For the prediction step, explanatory variable values that are deemed relevant to future  values of the dependent variable are input to the parameterized function to generate predictions for the dependent variable..",
    "In science, a prediction is a rigorous, often quantitative, statement, forecasting what would be observed under specific conditions; for example, according to theories of gravity, if an apple fell from a tree it would be seen to move towards the center of the earth with a specified and constant acceleration.",
    "A scientific theory whose predictions are contradicted by observations and evidence will be rejected.",
    "New theories that generate many new predictions can more easily be supported or falsified .",
    "Notions that make no testable predictions are usually considered not to be part of science  until testable predictions can be made.",
    "In some cases the probability of an outcome, rather than a specific outcome, can be predicted, for example in much of quantum physics.",
    "In microprocessors, branch prediction permits avoidance of pipeline emptying at branch instructions.",
    "In engineering, possible failure modes are predicted and avoided by correcting the failure mechanism causing the failure.",
    "Accurate prediction and forecasting are very difficult in some areas, such as natural disasters, pandemics, demography, population dynamics and meteorology.",
    "For example, it is possible to predict the occurrence of solar cycles, but their exact timing and magnitude is much more difficult .",
    "In materials engineering it is also possible to predict the life time of a material with a mathematical model..",
    "Established science makes useful predictions which are often extremely reliable and accurate; for example, eclipses are routinely predicted.",
    "New theories make predictions which allow them to be disproved by reality.",
    "For example, predicting the structure of crystals at the atomic level is a current research challenge. In the early 20th century the scientific consensus was that there existed an absolute frame of reference, which was given the name luminiferous ether."

    "Lower Saxony falls climatically into the north temperate zone of central Europe that is affected by prevailing Westerlies and is located in a transition zone between the maritime climate of Western Europe and the continental climate of Eastern Europe.",
    "This is clearly shown by greater temperature variations between the summer and winter halves of the year and in lower and more variable amounts of precipitation across the year.",
    "The highest levels of precipitation are experienced in the Harz because the Lower Saxon part forms the windward side of this mountain range against which orographic rain falls.",
    "Lower Saxony is divided into 37 districts :.",
    "On 1 January 2005 the four administrative regions or governorates , into which Lower Saxony had been hitherto divided, were dissolved. These were the governorates of Braunschweig, Hanover, Lüneburg and Weser-Ems.",

A comprehensive religious forecast for 2050 by the Pew Research Center predicts that the global Muslim population will grow at a faster rate than the Christian population – primarily due to the average younger age and higher fertility rate of Muslims. It is projected that birth rates – rather than conversion – will prove the main factor in the growth of any given religion. While according to various scholars and sources Pentecostalism – a Protestant Christian movement – is the fastest growing religion in the world, this growth is primarily due to religious conversion and denomination switching among Christians..",

    "Berger of Boston University \"the spread of Pentecostal Christianity may be the fastest growing movement in the history of religion\". Changes in worldwide Protestantism over the last century have been significant. Since 1900, due primarily to conversion, Protestantism has spread rapidly in Africa, Asia, Oceania and Latin America. That caused Protestantism to be called a primarily non-Western religion. Much of the growth has occurred after World War II, when decolonization of Africa and abolition of various restrictions against Protestants in Latin American countries occurred. According to one source, Protestants constituted respectively 2.5%, 2%, 0.5% of Latin Americans, Africans and Asians. In 2000, percentage of Protestants on mentioned continents was 17%, more than 27% and 5.5%, respectively..",
    "The paper concludes that the Pentecostalism movement is the fastest-growing religion worldwide. Protestantism is growing primarily as a result of historic missionary activity and the recently high fertility rate in Africa, and due primarily to conversion in China. According to scholar Paul Freston of Wilfrid Laurier University Pentecostalism continues to grow in Latin America, \"both by conversion and by high birth rates\". According to scholar Francis Fukuyama of Stanford University \"converts to Protestantism find their incomes, education levels, hygiene and social networks expanding\".

Also according to the historian Daniel Pipes of Harvard University and University of Chicago, and a researcher specializing in criticism of Islam, \"reports of widespread conversions of Muslims to Christianity come from regions as disparate as Algeria, Albania, Syria, and Kurdistan\", in northern Iraq and Algeria, the conversions of Kurds and Berbers to Christianity are unusually high.

    "Its GDP amounts to US$110.3 billion and thus $39,434 per capita. The city occupies the 40th place of highest gross earnings in the world. Most of the headquarters of multinational corporations in Portugal are located in the Lisbon area. It is also the political centre of the country, as its seat of government and residence of the head of state.",
    "Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in the world and the second-oldest European capital city , predating other modern European capitals by centuries. Julius Caesar made it a municipium called Felicitas Julia, adding to the name Olissipo.",
    "Lisbon's name may have been derived from Proto-Celtic or Celtic Olisippo, Lissoppo, or a similar name which other visiting peoples like the ancient Phoenicians, Greeks and Romans adapted accordingly, such as the pre-Roman appellation for the Tagus River, Lisso or Lucio.",
    "Classical authors writing in Latin and Greek, including Strabo, Solinus, and Martianus Capella, referred to popular legends that the city of Lisbon was founded by the mythical hero Ulysses . Lisbon's name was written Ulyssippo in Latin by the geographer Pomponius Mela, a native of Hispania.",
    "Another claim repeated in literature is that the name of Lisbon could be traced back to Phoenician times, referring to a supposed Phoenician term Alis-Ubbo, meaning \"safe harbour\" or \"pleasant haven\". Although modern archaeological excavations show a Phoenician presence at this location since 1200 BC, this folk etymology \"is never attested in ancient classical literature\"..",
    "Lisbon's name is commonly abbreviated as \"LX\" or \"Lx\", originating in an antiquated spelling of Lisbon as ‘‘Lixbõa’’. While the old spelling has since been completely dropped from usage and goes against modern language standards, the abbreviation is still commonly used.",
    "During the Neolithic period, the region was inhabited by Pre-Celtic tribes, who built religious and funerary monuments, megaliths, dolmens and menhirs, which still survive in areas on the periphery of Lisbon. The Indo-European Celts invaded in the 1st millennium BC, mixing with the Pre-Indo-European population, thus giving rise to Celtic-speaking local tribes such as the Cempsi or Sefes.",
    "Although the first fortifications on Lisbon's Castelo hill are known to be no older than the 2nd century BC, recent archaeological finds have shown that Iron Age people occupied the site from the 8th to 6th centuries BC. This indigenous settlement maintained commercial relations with the Phoenicians, which would account for the recent findings of Phoenician pottery and other material objects.",
    "Archaeological excavations made near the Castle of São Jorge  and Lisbon Cathedral indicate a Phoenician presence at this location since 1200 BC, and it can be stated with confidence that a Phoenician trading post stood on a site now the centre of the present city, on the southern slope of Castle hill. The sheltered harbour in the Tagus River estuary was an ideal spot for an Iberian settlement and would have provided a secure harbour for unloading and provisioning Phoenician ships. The Tagus settlement was an important centre of commercial trade with the inland tribes, providing an outlet for the valuable metals, salt and salted-fish they collected, and for the sale of the Lusitanian horses renowned in antiquity.",
    "The Germanic Suebi, who established a kingdom in Gallaecia , with its capital in Bracara Augusta, also controlled the region of Lisbon until 585.",
    "In 585, the Suebi Kingdom was integrated into the Germanic Visigothic Kingdom of Toledo, which comprised all of the Iberian Peninsula: Lisbon was then called Ulishbona.",
    "On 6 August 711, Lisbon was taken by Muslim forces.",
    "The Muslim influence is still visible in the Alfama district, an old quarter of Lisbon that survived the 1755 Lisbon earthquake: many place-names are derived from Arabic and the Alfama  was derived from the Arabic \"al-hamma\".",
    "For a brief time, Lisbon was an independent Muslim kingdom known as the Taifa of Lisbon , before being conquered by the larger Taifa of Badajoz.",
    "In 1108 Lisbon was raided and occupied by Norwegian crusaders led by Sigurd I on their way to the Holy Land as part of the Norwegian Crusade and occupied by crusader forces for three years. It was taken by the Moorish Almoravids in 1111.",
    "In 1147, as part of the Reconquista, crusader knights led by Afonso I of Portugal besieged and reconquered Lisbon.",
    "The reconquest of Portugal and re-establishment of Christianity is one of the most significant events in Lisbon's history, described in the chronicle Expugnatione Lyxbonensi, which describes, among other incidents, how the local bishop was killed by the crusaders and the city's residents prayed to the Virgin Mary as it happened.",
    "With its central location, Lisbon became the capital city of the new Portuguese territory in 1255.",
    "The first Portuguese university was founded in Lisbon in 1290 by King Denis I; for many years the Studium Generale  was transferred intermittently to Coimbra, where it was installed permanently in the 16th century as the University of Coimbra.",
    "When the Spaniards expelled the Jews from Spanish territory, many of the Jews fled to Lisbon.",
    "Although acknowledging the central importance of the Jews to the city's prosperity, Manuel I decreed in 1497 that all Jews must convert to Christianity, only those who refused being forced to leave, but not before the expropriation of their property. In 1506, an anti-semitic movement among the Old Christians of Lisbon culminated in a massacre lasting four days in which some 1,000 to 4,000 New Christian men, women and children, converted descendants of Sephardic Jews, are estimated to have been killed. The king was at Évora when these events occurred, but angered when he received the news, he ordered an investigation which resulted in two of the instigating friars being excommunicated and burned alive..",
    "Most of the Portuguese expeditions of the Age of Discovery left Lisbon during the period from the end of the 15th century to the beginning of the 17th century, including Vasco da Gama's expedition to India in 1498.",
    "The following years of the 16th century began Lisbon's golden era: the city was the European hub of commerce between Africa, India, the Far East and later, Brazil, and acquired great riches by exploiting the trade in spices, slaves, sugar, textiles and other goods.",
    "This period saw the rise of the exuberant Manueline style in architecture, which left its mark in many 16th-century monuments .",
    "A description of Lisbon in the 16th century was written by Damião de Góis and published in 1554..",
    "In 1589, Lisbon was the target of an incursion by the English Armada led by Francis Drake, while Queen Elizabeth supported a Portuguese pretender in Antonio, Prior of Crato, but support for Crato was lacking and the expedition was a failure."

    "\"Uncomfortable\" is a song by American hard rock band Halestorm from their fourth studio album, Vicious.",
    "\"Uncomfortable\" is a pop metal track with elements of speed metal and hard rock.",
    "Halestorm released their third studio album Into the Wild Life on April 14, 2015. This was followed by 2017's Reanimate 3.0: The Covers EP, produced by Nick Raskulinecz. When the band commenced work on their next album, they wrote and discarded 15 songs. Lead vocalist and guitarist Lzzy Hale was unhappy with the initial material; fearing that she was \"paying way too much attention making everybody happy\". Halestorm reunited with Raskulinecz for a series of jam sessions at his Nashville recording studio, Rock Falcon. \"Uncomfortable\" was the first song written for what would become Vicious. The song was written by band members Lzzy and Arejay Hale, Joe Hottinger, and Josh Smith..",
    "Musically, \"Uncomfortable\" is a pop metal track, with elements of speed metal and hard rock. It is written in the key of C major at a tempo of 119 beats per minute. Lead guitarist Hottinger told Classic Rock that the main riff was written as \"a joke\", and kept at Raskulinecz's urging. Lzzy Hale wrote the melody and lyrics about a month after the initial writing sessions. The lyrics are a response to Hale's earlier worries about pleasing other people, with the message being: \"You can't please everyone, there's always going to be someone disappointed, so you might as well make yourself happy and Be You.\" The vocal melody marks a departure from the usual anthemic stylings of Halestorm, relying on rapid-fire verses and a chorus centered on a vocal riff. It is set to an instrumental background of heavy electric guitar riffs and drum beats..",
    "Halestorm released \"Uncomfortable\" as the lead single from Vicious on May 30, 2018, as part of the larger album announcement. Hottinger was happy with the band's choice to make \"Uncomfortable\" the first single, \"because it's part of that whole idea of challenging things ..",
    "The song was released to positive reviews from music critics, with such descriptions as \"brilliant\", \"blistering\", and \"high-octane\". Axl Rosenberg of MetalSucks said, \"It's been a hot minute since there's been a pop-metal song this well put together,\" while Robert Pasbani of Metal Injection said that \"Uncomfortable \"has all the ingredients for a great pop metal song that will surely be all over rock radio and Sirius XM Octane all this summer\". Pasbani praised the \"great riffing, crunchy drums, and a really fun vocal performance,\" the last of which he compared to Joan Jett. Hale, when asked whether Halestorm gets nervous about releasing new music, said: \"You don't expect the worst, but you're prepared for the worst ..",

    "A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can typically be read in a single sitting and focuses on a self-contained incident or series of linked incidents, with the intent of evoking a single effect or mood.",
    "The short story is one of the oldest types of literature and has existed in the form of legends, mythic tales, folk tales, fairy tales, tall tales, fables and anecdotes in various ancient communities around the world.",
    "The modern short story developed in the early 19th century..",
    "The short story is a crafted form in its own right.",
    "Short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components as in a novel, but typically to a lesser degree.",
    "While the short story is largely distinct from the novel or novella/short novel, authors generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques. The short story is sometimes referred to as a genre..",
    "Determining what exactly defines a short story has been recurrently problematic. A classic definition of a short story is that one should be able to read it in one sitting, a point most notably made in Edgar Allan Poe's essay \"The Philosophy of Composition\" . H.G.",
    "Wells described the purpose of the short story as \"The jolly art, of making something very bright and moving; it may be horrible or pathetic or funny or profoundly illuminating, having only this essential, that it should take from fifteen to fifty minutes to read aloud.\" According to William Faulkner, a short story is character-driven and a writer's job is to \"...trot along behind him with a paper and pencil trying to keep up long enough to put down what he says and does.”.",
    "Some authors have argued that a short story must have a strict form.",
    "Somerset Maugham thought that the short story \"must have a definite design, which includes a point of departure, a climax and a point of test; in other words, it must have a plot\". Hugh Walpole had a similar view: \"A story should be a story; a record of things happening full of incidents, swift movements, unexpected development, leading through suspense to a climax and a satisfying denouement.\".",
    "This view of the short story as a finished product of art is however opposed by Anton Chekov, who thought that a story should have neither a beginning nor an end.",
    "Sukumar Azhikode defined a short story as \"a brief prose narrative with an intense episodic or anecdotal effect\". Flannery O'Connor emphasized the need to consider what is exactly meant by the descriptor short. Short story writers may define their works as part of the artistic and personal expression of the form.",
    "William Boyd, a British author and short story writer, has said:.",
    "In the 1880s, the term \"short story\" acquired its modern meaning – having initially referred to children's tales. During the early to mid-20th century, the short story underwent expansive experimentation which further hindered attempts to comprehensively provide a definition. Longer stories that cannot be called novels are sometimes considered \"novellas\" or novelettes and, like short stories, may be collected into the more marketable form of \"collections\", of stories previously unpublished or published, but elsewhere. Sometimes, authors who do not have the time or money to write a novella or novel decide to write short stories instead, working out a deal with a popular website or magazine to publish them for profit. Around the world, the modern short story is comparable to lyrics, dramas, novels and essays – although examination of it as a major literary form remains diminished..",
    "In terms of length, word count is typically anywhere from 1,000 to 4,000 for short stories; however, some have 15,000 words and are still classed as short stories.",
    "Stories of fewer than 1,000 words are sometimes referred to as \"short short stories\", or \"flash fiction\"..",
    "Short stories have no set length.",
    "In terms of word count, there is no official demarcation between an anecdote, a short story, and a novel.",
    "Rather, the form's parameters are given by the rhetorical and practical context in which a given story is produced and considered so that what constitutes a short story may differ between genres, countries, eras, and commentators. Like the novel, the short story's predominant shape reflects the demands of the available markets for publication, and the evolution of the form seems closely tied to the evolution of the publishing industry and the submission guidelines of its constituent houses..",
    "As a point of reference for the genre writer, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America define short story length in the Nebula Awards for science fiction submission guidelines as having fewer than 7,500 words..",
    "Short stories date back to oral storytelling traditions which originally produced epics such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and Homer's Iliad and Odyssey.",
    "Short sections of verse might focus on individual narratives that could be told at one sitting.",
    "According to Azhikode, the short story has existed \"in the most ancient times as the parable, the adventure-story of men, gods and demons, the account of daily events, the joke\". All languages have had variations of short tales and stories almost since their inceptions. Emerging in the 17th century from oral storytelling traditions, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization.",
    "\"The short story as a carefully contrived literary form is of modern origin\", wrote Azhikode..",
    "Another ancient form of short story, the anecdote, was popular under the Roman Empire.",
    "Both of these books are composed of individual short stories, which range from farce or humorous anecdotes to well-crafted literary fiction, set within a larger narrative story , although the frame-tale device was not adopted by all writers.",
    "At the end of the 16th century, some of the most popular short stories in Europe were the darkly tragic \"novella\" of Matteo Bandello, especially in their French translation.",
    "The mid 17th century in France saw the development of a refined short novel, the \"nouvelle\", by such authors as Madame de Lafayette.",

    "A Crow Looked at Me is the eighth studio album by Mount Eerie, a solo project of the American musician Phil Elverum.",
    "Characterized by lo-fi production and loose instrumentation, A Crow Looked at Me departs from Elverum's earlier and more complex experimental works, but is musically similar to his album Lost Wisdom .",
    "A Crow Looked at Me is Elverum's best selling record to date and is considered among his most important works.",
    "She died at their home in Anacortes, Washington, on July 9, 2016. Elverum considered retiring from music to become a full-time father, but a visit to the Canadian island Haida Gwaii—a place that Elverum and Castrée considered moving to—inspired him to write notes that, along with those he had written during her illness, became the lyrical basis for A Crow Looked at Me..",
    "Elverum chose the title A Crow Looked at Me to represent the \"uncomfortable feeling of applying significance to insignificant things\"..",
    "He reclaimed the room out of a need for a private space to work when not parenting. In an interview with KUOW, he said that he wanted to create positive associations with the room so that it would not be defined solely by Castrée's final days. He used a single microphone, an acoustic guitar, and some of Castrée's instruments. His decision was out of practicality, rather than from any intentional symbolic significance. The album was recorded onto a laptop computer, making A Crow Looked at Me his first album to be produced entirely in this way—he had before mostly used analog recording..",
    "The lyrics are written in a style of poetic literalism with a sense of mysticism. Their main themes are Castrée's illness and death as well as Elverum's grief. Ideas of impermanence, emptiness, disorientation, and the absurdity of performing intimate material in public are present as well. Paste's Matt Fink suggested that although Elverum's repertoire of songs about mortality is perhaps second only to those about nature, A Crow Looked at Me \"marks the first time he has written about death\"..",
    "The work's exploration of death has been compared to the Antlers' Hospice , David Bowie's Blackstar  and Sufjan Stevens's Carrie & Lowell , although, as highlighted by writer Isabel Zacharias, A Crow Looked at Me focuses more on the grieving process and its mundane aspects than these albums do. Many of the lyrics reference nature. One reviewer said that \"tragedy hasn't stopped  from noticing the world; if anything, it seems to have pried his eyes open for good\". Unlike in his past works, he forgoes his \"general focus on nature's 'raw impermanence'\". Throughout, Elverum returns to motifs such as his house—in particular, the room where Castrée died—and the minutiae of his life..",
    "The music is reminiscent of his 2008 albums Dawn and Lost Wisdom; its songs avoid standard musical structures and have sparse instrumentation—individual instruments enter and leave at unpredictable times—a drum machine producing a hiss-like sound, acoustic guitar, chord changes, an absence of choruses, unorthodox verse structure, and very few melodies. The songs are short—lasting on average less than four minutes—and typically end abruptly, avoiding codas and fade outs. They include unresolved notes and chords; the ending of \"Seaweed\", for example, hangs on a half-step descent. The simplicity of the songs reflects Elverum's wish to move away from his earlier, more \"artistically challenging\" work, which is characterized by \"harsh tones\" and \"complicated chords\". Jayson Greene of Pitchfork explained the contrast to Elverum's earlier work as similar to \"the difference between charting a voyage around the earth and undertaking it\". Elverum has described A Crow Looked at Me as \"barely music\"..",
    "A Crow Looked at Me received widespread critical acclaim, with Elverum receiving more attention from reviewers than before and earning some of the best reviews of his career. It was one of the most critically acclaimed albums of 2017 and Elverum's best selling to date. Elverum found the album's positive reception as reaffirming but \"strange and absurd\".",

It ranked 15th in The Village Voice's Pazz & Jop poll, which collected top-ten ballots of more than 400 critics from across the United States that year. In readers' polls conducted by Pitchfork and Stereogum, the album placed at number seven and number four, respectively. It was featured on several lists of the best albums of the 2010s decade, including a top-20 placement by Noisey. According to a survey of decade-end lists by the Seattle Metropolitan, it was the most-mentioned album by an artist from the Seattle area..",
    "Levinson echoed a similar sentiment. Frank Falisi of Tiny Mix Tapes cited it as one of the albums of the 2010s that \" the understanding of popular music\". Both The Guardian's John Robinson and Craig Jenkins of Vulture highlighted it as an example of a new personal style of songwriting. The Village Voice said that the \"absoluteness of Elverum's literalism\" is \"one reason A Crow Looked at Me is some kind of classic\"..",
    "In 2017, the American rapper Danny Brown named A Crow Looked at Me as his favorite album of the year; Elverum publicly thanked Brown and later noted that his endorsement had caused a greater increase in sales than the album's appearance on the New York Times year-end list. Michelle Zauner of Japanese Breakfast chose it as one of the five albums that changed her life and said that it helped her cope with the death of her mother.

    "A people named Israel appear for the first time in the Merneptah Stele, an ancient Egyptian inscription which dates to about 1200 BCE. Ancestors of the Israelites are thought to have included ancient Semitic-speaking peoples native to this area.: 78–79  According to the modern archaeological account, the Israelites and their culture branched out of the Canaanite peoples and their cultures through the development of a distinct monolatristic—and later monotheistic—religion centered on Yahweh. They spoke an archaic form of the Hebrew language, known as Biblical Hebrew. Around the same time, the Philistines settled on the southern coastal plain..",
    "Modern archaeology has largely discarded the historicity of the narrative in the Torah concerning the patriarchs, The Exodus, and the conquest of Canaan described in the Book of Joshua, and instead views the narrative as constituting the Israelites' national myth. However, some elements of these traditions do appear to have historical roots..",
    "On 14 May 1948, the day before the expiration of the British Mandate, David Ben-Gurion, the head of the Jewish Agency, declared \"the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz-Israel, to be known as the State of Israel.\" The only reference in the text of the Declaration to the borders of the new state is the use of the term Eretz-Israel . The following day, the armies of four Arab countries—Egypt, Syria, Transjordan and Iraq—entered into parts of what had been British Mandatory Palestine, launching the 1948 Arab–Israeli War; contingents from Yemen, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Sudan joined the war. The apparent purpose of the invasion was to prevent the establishment of the Jewish state at inception, and some Arab leaders talked about \"driving the Jews into the sea\". According to Benny Morris, Jews were worried that the invading Arab armies held the intent to slaughter them. The Arab league stated the invasion was to restore law and order and to prevent further bloodshed..",
    "The UN estimated that more than 700,000 Palestinians were expelled by or fled from advancing Israeli forces during the conflict—what would become known in Arabic as the Nakba . Some 156,000 remained and became Arab citizens of Israel..",
    "Israel was admitted as a member of the UN by majority vote on 11 May 1949. An Israeli-Jordanian attempt at negotiating a peace agreement broke down after the British government, fearful of the Egyptian reaction to such a treaty, expressed their opposition to the Jordanian government. In the early years of the state, the Labor Zionist movement led by Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion dominated Israeli politics..",
    "Immigration to Israel during the late 1940s and early 1950s was aided by the Israeli Immigration Department and the non-government sponsored Mossad LeAliyah Bet (lit.",
    "During the 1950s, Israel was frequently attacked by Palestinian fedayeen, nearly always against civilians, mainly from the Egyptian-occupied Gaza Strip, leading to several Israeli reprisal operations.",
    "The continued blockade of the Suez Canal and Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping, together with the growing amount of Fedayeen attacks against Israel's southern population, and recent Arab grave and threatening statements, prompted Israel to attack Egypt. Israel joined a secret alliance with the United Kingdom and France and overran the Sinai Peninsula but was pressured to withdraw by the UN in return for guarantees of Israeli shipping rights in the Red Sea via the Straits of Tiran and the Canal. The war, known as the Suez Crisis, resulted in significant reduction of Israeli border infiltration. In the early 1960s, Israel captured Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in Argentina and brought him to Israel for trial. The trial had a major impact on public awareness of the Holocaust. Eichmann remains the only person executed in Israel by conviction in an Israeli civilian court. During the spring and summer of 1963 Israel was engaged in a diplomatic standoff with the United States due to the Israeli nuclear programme..",
    "Since 1964, Arab countries, concerned over Israeli plans to divert waters of the Jordan River into the coastal plain, had been trying to divert the headwaters to deprive Israel of water resources, provoking tensions between Israel on the one hand, and Syria and Lebanon on the other.",
    "Arab nationalists led by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser refused to recognize Israel and called for its destruction. By 1966, Israeli-Arab relations had deteriorated to the point of actual battles taking place between Israeli and Arab forces. In May 1967, Egypt massed its army near the border with Israel, expelled UN peacekeepers, stationed in the Sinai Peninsula since 1957, and blocked Israel's access to the Red Sea. Other Arab states mobilized their forces. Israel reiterated that these actions were a casus belli and, on 5 June, launched a pre-emptive strike against Egypt.",
    "Following the 1967 war and the \"Three Nos\" resolution of the Arab League, Israel faced attacks from the Egyptians in the Sinai Peninsula during the 1967–1970 War of Attrition, and from Palestinian groups targeting Israelis in the occupied territories, in Israel proper, and around the world.",
    "Most important among the various Palestinian and Arab groups was the Palestinian Liberation Organization , established in 1964, which initially committed itself to \"armed struggle as the only way to liberate the homeland\". In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Palestinian groups launched a wave of attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets around the world, including a massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich.",
    "The Israeli government responded with an assassination campaign against the organizers of the massacre, a bombing and a raid on the PLO headquarters in Lebanon.",
    "On 6 October 1973, as Jews were observing Yom Kippur, the Egyptian and Syrian armies launched a surprise attack against Israeli forces in the Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights, that opened the Yom Kippur War.",
    "Israeli commandos carried out an operation in which 102 out of 106 Israeli hostages were successfully rescued.",
    "The 1977 Knesset elections marked a major turning point in Israeli political history as Menachem Begin's Likud party took control from the Labor Party. Later that year, Egyptian President Anwar El Sadat made a trip to Israel and spoke before the Knesset in what was the first recognition of Israel by an Arab head of state. In the two years that followed, Sadat and Begin signed the Camp David Accords  and the Egypt–Israel peace treaty . In return, Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula and agreed to enter negotiations over an autonomy for Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip..",
    "Meanwhile, Begin's government provided incentives for Israelis to settle in the occupied West Bank, increasing friction with the Palestinians in that area. The Basic Law: Jerusalem, Capital of Israel, passed in 1980, was believed by some to reaffirm Israel's 1967 annexation of Jerusalem by government decree, and reignited international controversy over the status of the city.",
    "No Israeli legislation has defined the territory of Israel and no act specifically included East Jerusalem therein. In 1981 Israel effectively annexed the Golan Heights, although annexation was not recognized internationally. The international community largely rejected these moves, with the UN Security Council declaring both the Jerusalem Law and the Golan Heights Law null and void. Israel's population diversity expanded in the 1980s and 1990s.",
    "On 7 June 1981, during the Iran–Iraq War, the Israeli air force destroyed Iraq's sole nuclear reactor under construction just outside Baghdad, in order to impede Iraq's nuclear weapons programme.",
    "Following a series of PLO attacks in 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon that year to destroy the bases from which the PLO launched attacks and missiles into northern Israel. In the first six days of fighting, the Israelis destroyed the military forces of the PLO in Lebanon and decisively defeated the Syrians.",
    "An Israeli government inquiry—the Kahan Commission—would later hold Begin and several Israeli generals as indirectly responsible for the Sabra and Shatila massacre and hold Defense minister Ariel Sharon as bearing \"personal responsibility\" for the massacre. Sharon was forced to resign as Defense Minister. In 1985, Israel responded to a Palestinian terrorist attack in Cyprus by bombing the PLO headquarters in Tunisia."

    "A thing that lacks rationality is either arational, if it is outside the domain of rational evaluation, or irrational, if it belongs to this domain but does not fulfill its standards.",
    "There are many discussions about the essential features shared by all forms of rationality.",
    "According to reason-responsiveness accounts, to be rational is to be responsive to reasons.",
    "For example, dark clouds are a reason for taking an umbrella, which is why it is rational for an agent to do so in response.",

    "Goal-based accounts characterize rationality in relation to goals, such as acquiring truth in the case of theoretical rationality.",
    "Internalists believe that rationality depends only on the person's mind.",
    "Debates about the normativity of rationality concern the question of whether one should always be rational.",
    "A further discussion is whether rationality requires that all beliefs are reviewed from scratch rather than trusting pre-existing beliefs.",
    "Various types of rationality are discussed in the academic literature.",
    "The most influential distinction is between theoretical and practical rationality.",
    "Theoretical rationality concerns the rationality of beliefs.",
    "Rational beliefs are based on evidence that supports them.",
    "Practical rationality pertains primarily to actions.",
    "In some cases, the two can conflict, as when practical rationality requires that one adopts an irrational belief.",
    "Another distinction is between ideal rationality, which demands that rational agents obey all the laws and implications of logic, and bounded rationality, which takes into account that this is not always possible since the computational power of the human mind is too limited.",
    "Most academic discussions focus on the rationality of individuals.",
    "This contrasts with social or collective rationality, which pertains to collectives and their group beliefs and decisions.",

    "Cognitive and behavioral sciences usually assume that people are rational to predict how they think and act.",
    "These laws are highly relevant for the rationality of beliefs.",
    "A very influential conception of practical rationality is given in decision theory: it states that a decision is rational if the chosen option has the highest expected utility.",
    "In its most common sense, rationality is the quality of being guided by reasons or being reasonable. For example, a person who acts rationally has good reasons for what they do.",
    "In the case of beliefs, it is rational to believe something if the agent has good evidence for it and it is coherent with the agent's other beliefs. While actions and beliefs are the most paradigmatic forms of rationality, the term is used both in ordinary language and in many academic disciplines to describe a wide variety of things, such as persons, desires, intentions, decisions, policies, and institutions. Because of this variety in different contexts, it has proven difficult to give a unified definition covering all these fields and usages.",

    "The name for Japan in Japanese is written using the kanji 日本 and is pronounced Nippon or Nihon. Before 日本 was adopted in the early 8th century, the country was known in China as Wa  and in Japan by the endonym Yamato. Nippon, the original Sino-Japanese reading of the characters, is favored for official uses, including on banknotes and postage stamps. Nihon is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period. The characters 日本 mean \"sun origin\", which is the source of the popular Western epithet \"Land of the Rising Sun\"..",
    "Buddhism was introduced to Japan from Baekje  in 552, but the development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China. Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class, including figures like Prince Shōtoku, and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period ..",
    "The Nara period  marked the emergence of a Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heijō-kyō .",
    "The period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literary culture with the completion of the Kojiki  and Nihon Shoki , as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired artwork and architecture. A smallpox epidemic in 735–737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population. In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital, settling on Heian-kyō  in 794. This marked the beginning of the Heian period , during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged.",
    "He was appointed shōgun by Emperor Go-Yōzei in 1603 and established the Tokugawa shogunate at Edo . The shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto, as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimyō, and in 1639 the isolationist sakoku  policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period . Modern Japan's economic growth began in this period, resulting in roads and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers. The study of Western sciences  continued through contact with the Dutch enclave in Nagasaki. The Edo period gave rise to kokugaku , the study of Japan by the Japanese..",
    "Perry and the \"Black Ships\" of the United States Navy forced the opening of Japan to the outside world with the Convention of Kanagawa. Subsequent similar treaties with other Western countries brought economic and political crises. The resignation of the shōgun led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor . Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution , and assembled the Imperial Diet. During the Meiji period , the Empire of Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence. After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War  and the Russo-Japanese War , Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin. The Japanese population doubled from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million by 1935, with a significant shift to urbanization..",
    "The Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War . In 1940, the Empire invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan. On December 7–8, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, as well as on British forces in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong, among others, beginning World War II in the Pacific. Throughout areas occupied by Japan during the war, numerous abuses were committed against local inhabitants, with many forced into sexual slavery. After Allied victories during the next four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender. The war cost Japan its colonies and millions of lives. The Allies  repatriated millions of Japanese settlers from their former colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Japanese Empire and its influence over the territories it conquered. The Allies convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East to prosecute Japanese leaders for war crimes..",

Traditionally, Copenhagen's founding has been dated to Bishop Absalon's construction of a modest fortress on the little island of Slotsholmen in 1167 where Christiansborg Palace stands today. The construction of the fortress was in response to attacks by Wendish pirates who plagued the coastline during the 12th century. Defensive ramparts and moats were completed and by 1177 St.",
    "Attacks by the Wends continued, and after the original fortress was eventually destroyed by the marauders, islanders replaced it with Copenhagen Castle..",
    "In 1186, a letter from Pope Urban III states that the castle of Hafn  and its surrounding lands, including the town of Hafn, were given to Absalon, Bishop of Roskilde 1158–1191 and Archbishop of Lund 1177–1201, by King Valdemar I.",
    "As the fishing industry thrived in Copenhagen, particularly in the trade of herring, the city began expanding to the north of Slotsholmen. In 1254, it received a charter as a city under Bishop Jakob Erlandsen who garnered support from the local fishing merchants against the king by granting them special privileges. In the mid 1330s, the first land assessment of the city was published..",
    "With the establishment of the Kalmar Union  between Denmark, Norway and Sweden, by about 1416 Copenhagen had emerged as the capital of Denmark when Eric of Pomerania moved his seat to Copenhagen Castle. The University of Copenhagen was inaugurated on 1 June 1479 by King Christian I, following approval from Pope Sixtus IV. This makes it the oldest university in Denmark and one of the oldest in Europe.",
    "Copenhagen's defences were reinforced with a series of towers along the city wall.",
    "During the reign of Christian IV between 1588 and 1648, Copenhagen had dramatic growth as a city.",
    "It was initially intended to be a fortified trading centre but ultimately became part of Copenhagen. Christian IV also sponsored an array of ambitious building projects including Rosenborg Slot and the Rundetårn. In 1658–1659, the city withstood a siege by the Swedes under Charles X and successfully repelled a major assault..",
    "By 1661, Copenhagen had asserted its position as capital of Denmark and Norway."

  "ethical": [
    "The word ethics in English refers to several things. It can refer to philosophical ethics or moral philosophy—a project that attempts to use reason to answer various kinds of ethical questions.",
    "As the English moral philosopher Bernard Williams writes, attempting to explain moral philosophy: \"What makes an inquiry a philosophical one is reflective generality and a style of argument that claims to be rationally persuasive.\" Williams describes the content of this area of inquiry as addressing the very broad question, \"how one should live\". Ethics can also refer to a common human ability to think about ethical problems that is not particular to philosophy.",
    "Meta-ethics is the branch of philosophical ethics that asks how we understand, know about, and what we mean when we talk about what is right and what is wrong. An ethical question pertaining to a particular practical situation—such as, \"Should I eat this particular piece of chocolate cake?\"—cannot be a meta-ethical question .",
    "A meta-ethical question is abstract and relates to a wide range of more specific practical questions.",
    "For example, \"Is it ever possible to have a secure knowledge of what is right and wrong?\" is a meta-ethical question..",
    "For example, Aristotle implies that less precise knowledge is possible in ethics than in other spheres of inquiry, and he regards ethical knowledge as depending upon habit and acculturation in a way that makes it distinctive from other kinds of knowledge.",
    "The ontology of ethics is about value-bearing things or properties, that is, the kind of things or stuff referred to by ethical propositions.",
    "Non-descriptivists and non-cognitivists believe that ethics does not need a specific ontology since ethical propositions do not refer.",
    "Moral skepticism  is a class of metaethical theories in which all members entail that no one has any moral knowledge.",
    "Normative ethics is the study of ethical action.",
    "However, on certain versions of the meta-ethical view called moral realism, moral facts are both descriptive and prescriptive at the same time..",
    "Virtue ethics describes the character of a moral agent as a driving force for ethical behavior, and it is used to describe the ethics of early Greek philosophers such as Socrates and Aristotle, and ancient Indian philosophers such as Valluvar.",
    "Aristotle  posited an ethical system that may be termed \"virtuous.\" In Aristotle's view, when a person acts in accordance with virtue this person will do good and be content.",
    "As a deeply devoted Christian herself, Anscombe proposed that either those who do not give ethical credence to notions of divine law take up virtue ethics, which does not necessitate universal laws as agents themselves are investigated for virtue or vice and held up to \"universal standards\", or that those who wish to be utilitarian or consequentialist ground their theories in religious conviction. Alasdair MacIntyre, who wrote the book After Virtue, was a key contributor and proponent of modern virtue ethics, although some claim that MacIntyre supports a relativistic account of virtue based on cultural norms, not objective standards. Martha Nussbaum, a contemporary virtue ethicist, objects to MacIntyre's relativism, among that of others, and responds to relativist objections to form an objective account in her work \"Non-Relative Virtues: An Aristotelian Approach\". However, Nussbaum's accusation of relativism appears to be a misreading.",
    "Ethical intuitionism  is a family of views in moral epistemology .",
    "At minimum, ethical intuitionism is the thesis that our intuitive awareness of value, or intuitive knowledge of evaluative facts, forms the foundation of our ethical knowledge.",
    "As such, ethical intuitionism is to be contrasted with coherentist approaches to moral epistemology, such as those that depend on reflective equilibrium..",
    "Throughout the philosophical literature, the term \"ethical intuitionism\" is frequently used with significant variation in its sense.",
    "This article's focus on foundationalism reflects the core commitments of contemporary self-identified ethical intuitionists..",
    "Sufficiently broadly defined, ethical intuitionism can be taken to encompass cognitivist forms of moral sense theory. It is usually furthermore taken as essential to ethical intuitionism that there be self-evident or a priori moral knowledge; this counts against considering moral sense theory to be a species of intuitionism..",
    "Ethical intuitionism was first clearly shown in use by the philosopher Francis Hutcheson.",
    "Later ethical intuitionists of influence and note include Henry Sidgwick, G.E.",
    "Objections to ethical intuitionism include whether or not there are objective moral values  the question of why many disagree over ethics if they are absolute, and whether Occam's razor cancels such a theory out entirely..",
    "In their consideration of consequences, they range from those advocating self-gratification regardless of the pain and expense to others, to those stating that the most ethical pursuit maximizes pleasure and happiness for the most people.: 37.",
    "State consequentialism, also known as Mohist consequentialism, is an ethical theory that evaluates the moral worth of an action based on how much it contributes to the basic goods of a state. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy describes Mohist consequentialism, dating back to the 5th century BC, as \"a remarkably sophisticated version based on a plurality of intrinsic goods taken as constitutive of human welfare\". Unlike utilitarianism, which views pleasure as a moral good, \"the basic goods in Mohist consequentialist thinking are … order, material wealth, and increase in population\". During Mozi's era, war and famines were common, and population growth was seen as a moral necessity for a harmonious society.",
    "Anscombe in her essay \"Modern Moral Philosophy\" in 1958, to describe what she saw as the central error of certain moral theories, such as those propounded by Mill and Sidgwick. Since then, the term has become common in English-language ethical theory.",
    "Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that argues the proper course of action is one that maximizes a positive effect, such as \"happiness\", \"welfare\", or the ability to live according to personal preferences. Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill are influential proponents of this school of thought.",
    "Kant's argument that to act in the morally right way one must act purely from duty begins with an argument that the highest good must be both good in itself and good without qualification. Something is \"good in itself\" when it is intrinsically good, and \"good without qualification\", when the addition of that thing never makes a situation ethically worse.",
    "Pleasure, for example, appears not to be good without qualification, because when people take pleasure in watching someone suffer, this seems to make the situation ethically worse.",
    "Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached. Like Kantian ethics, discourse ethics is a cognitive ethical theory, in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions."

    "Madonna has performed \"Deeper and Deeper\" in three of her concert tours, the last being 2015–2016's Rebel Heart Tour.",
    "The first batch of songs they worked together on were \"Erotica\", \"Deeper and Deeper\", \"Rain\" and \"Thief of Hearts\". Anthony Shimkin, who also worked on the album, recalled that Madonna had with her a \"book full of lyrics and melody ideas\"..",
    "She wanted Erotica to have a raw edge, as if it were recorded in an alley in Harlem, and not a light glossy production, according to Pettibone. In the case of \"Deeper and Deeper\", the producer revealed that they tried different bridges and changes, but in the end, Madonna wanted the middle of the song to have a flamenco guitar, an idea he disagreed with; \"I didn't like  taking a Philly house song and putting 'La Isla Bonita' in the middle of it.",
    "\"Deeper and Deeper\" was written and produced by both Madonna and Pettibone, with additional lyrics by Anthony Shimkin. Recording took place at Astoria's Sound Work Studios; personnel working on the song included Pettibone on the sequencing, keyboard arrangement, and programming, alongside Shimkin; Paul Pesco on guitars, Dennis Mitchell and Robin Hancock were the song's recording engineers, while George Karras was the mixing engineer.",
    "Background vocals were provided by Niki Haris and Donna De Lory. Musically, \"Deeper and Deeper\" is a house-flavored track with disco and Philadelphia soul influences. Its lyrics talk about sexual desire, but Dan Cadan argued in his text in the liner notes of GHV2 , that they are actually about a young man coming to terms with his homosexuality. Madonna herself described the lyrics as \"not terribly intellectual\". Shimkin said he saw the song as a \"big nod\" to Madonna's earlier works with John \"Jellybean\" Benitez; De Lory on the other hand, recalled that \"'d sung with  before so it was just a really comfortable relationship.",
    "\"Deeper and Deeper\" begins with Madonna singing \"Deeper and deeper and deeper\", followed by the refrain \"I can't help falling in love, I fall deeper and deeper the further I go\". The song's opening line \"When you know the notes to sing, you can sing most anything\" references \"Do-Re-Mi\" from The Sound of Music . Also present are \"a juxtaposition of swirling disco synths\", a flamenco guitar, and castanets on its bridge. According to the sheet music published by Alfred Publishing Inc., \"Deeper and Deeper\" is set in the time signature of common time with a fast tempo of 120 beats per minute.",
    "In Australia and most European countries, \"Deeper and Deeper\" was released as the official second single from the Erotica album on November 17, 1992; in the United States, it was released on December 8. It was then included on Madonna's second compilation album, GHV2 . Upon release, the song was met with generally positive reviews from music critics.",
    "A straight-ahead house groove in the tradition of the funkiest New York clubs\". Similarly, Billboard's Joe Lynch expressed that \"if 'Erotica' was a bold sonic departure for Madonna, the second single, 'Deeper and Deeper', found her in more familiar disco and house territory\". Also from Billboard, Larry Flick stated that \"the chorus embeds in your brain upon impact\", and highlighted the \"Vogue\" sample as \"one of the song's cooler moments\". On his review of Erotica, the magazine's Paul Verna referred to \"Deeper and Deeper\" as a \"playful disco-throwback\". AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered it among Madonna's \"best and most accomplished music\". For Rolling Stone, Arion Berger highlighted the track as one of the album's \"pure disco\" moments that do not need \"emotional resonance to make them race\". Anthony Violanti from The Buffalo News compared \"Deeper and Deeper\" to the work of Donna Summer. J.",
    "Entertainment Weekly's David Browne opined the single \"whooshes like a subway train going express at 4 a.m.\". Charlotte Robinson of PopMatters hailed it a \"great pop song about the importance of listening to Mom and Dad's advice\". For Q's Phil Sutcliffe, \"Deeper and Deeper\" was the biggest surprise on Erotica that \"could be mistaken for a bopalong tribute to Kylie\". At Blender, Tony Powers considered it one of the album's standout tracks. Music writer James Masterton praised Madonna for returning to the \"basic pop/dance she does best\", but felt the song did not have \"chart topping potential\". Barbara Walker, writing in the Sun-Sentinel, opined that \"the set's showcase dance track, 'Deeper and Deeper', never quite takes off\", and deemed the \"Vogue\" sample lazy. In a less favorable review, Cashbox's Randy Clark dismissed its \"soulless and formulaic disco/kiddie-pop sounds dating back to 'Into the Groove'\" and \"simpleton Madonna lyrics  overdone melodic phrases\"..",
    "In 2011, Slant Magazine placed the song at number 36 on their list of \"The 100 Best Singles of the 1990s\"; Ed Gonzalez wrote, \"among Madonna's finest achievements, the angsty pop anthem 'Deeper and Deeper' is both an acute distillation of Erotica's smut-glam decadence and the singer's lifelong blond ambition\". Matthew Jacobs from HuffPost placed the song at number 35 of his ranking of Madonna's singles, calling it her \"finest disco flourish\". On Gay Star News' ranking, the single came in at number 11; Joe Morgan called it \"infectious, entrancing and one of her best dance anthems\". Jude Rogers, from The Guardian, opined \"Deeper and Deeper\" is a \"classy post-'Vogue' excursion into 90s R&B\", and placed it at number 27 of her ranking of Madonna singles. Nayer Missim from PinkNews considered \"Deeper and Deeper\" Madonna's 19th greatest song, and Entertainment Weekly's Chuck Arnold her 25th; the former said it is \"house and pop that’s equal parts disco and bedroom\", while the latter deemed it a sequel to \"Vogue\", due to the lyrical nod. Louis Virtel, writing for The Backlot, named \"Deeper and Deeper\" the seventh best song of Madonna's discography, referring to it as \"jubilant and driving\", and comparing it to her 1987 single \"Causing a Commotion\". The song has also been considered one of Madonna's most underrated singles; for PopCrush, Taylor Dougherty named it the singer's second \"most underappreciated\" track: \"By far Erotica's strongest moment, 'Deeper and Deeper' might just be one of the greatest disco-infused dance epics of the early '90s — but one that still holds up today  one of Madonna's greatest tracks, and one that doesn't nearly get the credit it deserve\". Idolator's Robbie Daw deemed it Madonna's best song that \"radio forgot\". On a similar note, The Tab's Harrison Brocklehurst referred to \"Deeper and Deeper\" as \"the true star\" of the album, and as one of the singer's best songs that \"you’d never hear on the radio – just in the clubs that know how great it really is\". Finally, Nick Levine from NME also deemed it underrated and said it deserves to be \"embraced as a classic\"..",
    "\"Deeper and Deeper\" debuted on the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 38 the week of December 5, 1992, and quickly climbed up the chart, ultimately peaking at number 7 on the week of January 30, 1993, remaining on the chart for seventeen weeks in total. On the Hot 100 Airplay and Top Singles Sales charts, it peaked at numbers 8 and 15, respectively.

Guilbert also pointed out references to Italian director Luchino Visconti, and actor John Travolta in the 1977 film Saturday Night Fever.",

Sal Cinquemani considered it \"weird, dark, and alluring\", as well as Madonna's 21st greatest music video.

The staff of The Washington Times opined that the singer displayed \"vocal nuances we didn’t know she had\", while Kevin Naff from Southern Voice highlighted the \"beautifully reworked\" rendition. It was sung in its original form on the Rebel Heart Tour; the number featured line dancing and, on one point, a dancer carried Madonna in a piggyback style, while the backdrop screen showed a jukebox. Entertainment Weekly's Melissa Maerz noted that the song was infused with a \"pulsing house undercurrent that felt contemporary again\". For PopCrush, Bradley Stern pointed out that during the performance, the singer and dancers \"exploded with the same joyous energy of the club delight of the song’s video\".

    "Agriculture and forestry face a triple challenge of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, preventing the further conversion of forests to agricultural land, and meeting increases in world food demand. A set of actions could reduce agriculture and forestry-based emissions by two thirds from 2010 levels.",
    "Natural carbon sinks can be enhanced to sequester significantly larger amounts of CO2 beyond naturally occurring levels. Reforestation and tree planting on non-forest lands are among the most mature sequestration techniques, although the latter raises food security concerns. Farmers can promote sequestration of carbon in soils through practices such as use of winter cover crops, reducing the intensity and frequency of tillage, and using compost and manure as soil amendments. Restoration/recreation of coastal wetlands and seagrass meadows increases the uptake of carbon into organic matter . When carbon is sequestered in soils and in organic matter such as trees, there is a risk of the carbon being re-released into the atmosphere later through changes in land use, fire, or other changes in ecosystems.."

Before leaving, Mercury announced, \"when we come back to Australia, Queen will be the biggest band in the world!\" Queen II was released in March, and features Mick Rock's iconic Dietrich-inspired image of the band on the cover. This image would later be used as the basis for \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" music video production. The album reached number five on the British album chart and became the first Queen album to chart in the UK.",
    "The Mercury-written lead single \"Seven Seas of Rhye\" reached number 10 in the UK, giving the band their first hit. The album featured a 'layered' sound which would become their signature, and features long complex instrumental passages, fantasy-themed lyrics, and instrumental virtuosity. Aside from its only single, the album also included the song \"The March of the Black Queen\", a six-minute epic which lacks a chorus. Critical reaction was mixed; the Winnipeg Free Press, while praising the band's debut album, described Queen II as an \"over-produced monstrosity\". AllMusic has described the album as a favourite among the band's hardcore fans, and it is the first of three Queen albums to feature in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. The group ended their early 1974 UK tour with a show at the Rainbow Theatre on 31 March.",

It reached number two on the British charts, and became their first US hit, reaching number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was partly recorded at Rockfield Studios in Wales. With Mercury playing the grand piano, it combines camp, vaudeville, and British music hall with May's guitar.",

The Irish climate is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and thus very moderate, and winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area, although summers are cooler than those in continental Europe.",
    "A war of independence in the early 20th century was followed by the partition of the island, leading to the creation of the Irish Free State, which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom.",
    "Irish culture has had a significant influence on other cultures, especially in the field of literature.",
    "Alongside mainstream Western culture, a strong indigenous culture exists, as expressed through Gaelic games, Irish music, Irish language, and Irish dance.",

Some restructuring had already begun at the ecclesiastical level following the Synod of Kells in 1152. There has been significant controversy regarding the authenticity of Laudabiliter, and there is no general agreement as to whether the bull was genuine or a forgery. Further, it had no standing in the Irish legal system.",

    "their specific topic, is not important for whether the inference is valid or not. Valid inferences are characterized by the fact that the truth of their premises ensures the truth of their conclusion: it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false. The general logical structures characterizing valid inferences are called rules of inference. In this sense, logic is often defined as the study of valid inference. This contrasts with another prominent characterization of logic as the science of logical truths. A proposition is logically true if its truth depends only on the logical vocabulary used in it.",
    "This means that it is true in all possible worlds and under all interpretations of its non-logical terms. These two characterizations of logic are closely related to each other: an inference is valid if the material conditional from its premises to its conclusion is logically true..",

After centuries of political and territorial divisions, Italy was almost entirely unified in 1861 following a war of independence, establishing the Kingdom of Italy. From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, Italy rapidly industrialised, mainly in the north, and acquired a colonial empire, while the south remained largely impoverished and excluded from industrialisation, fuelling a large and influential diaspora.

    "The Philippines has diverse ethnicities and cultures throughout its islands.",
    "Spanish settlement through Mexico, beginning in 1565, led to the Philippines becoming ruled by the Spanish Empire for more than 300 years.",
    "Following liberation, the Philippines became independent in 1946.",
    "The Philippines is an emerging market and a newly industrialized country whose economy is transitioning from being agriculture centered to services and manufacturing centered.",
    "The location of the Philippines as an island country both on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes it prone to earthquakes and typhoons.",
    "During the Philippine Revolution, the Malolos Congress proclaimed the establishment of the República Filipina or the Philippine Republic. From the period of the Spanish–American War  and the Philippine–American War  until the Commonwealth period , American colonial authorities referred to the country as The Philippine Islands, a translation of the Spanish name. The United States began the process of changing the reference to the country from The Philippine Islands to The Philippines, specifically when it was mentioned in the Philippine Autonomy Act or the Jones Law. The full official title, Republic of the Philippines, was included in the 1935 constitution as the name of the future independent state, it is also mentioned in all succeeding constitutional revisions..",
    "There is evidence of early hominins living in what is now the Philippines as early as 709,000 years ago. A small number of bones from Callao Cave potentially represent an otherwise unknown species, Homo luzonensis, that lived around 50,000 to 67,000 years ago. The oldest modern human remains found on the islands are from the Tabon Caves of Palawan, U/Th-dated to 47,000 ± 11–10,000 years ago. The Tabon Man is presumably a Negrito, who were among the archipelago's earliest inhabitants, descendants of the first human migrations out of Africa via the coastal route along southern Asia to the now sunken landmasses of Sundaland and Sahul..",
    "The first Austronesians reached the Philippines from Taiwan in around 2200 BC, settling the Batanes Islands and northern Luzon.",
    "From there, they rapidly spread southwards to the rest of the islands of the Philippines and Southeast Asia. This population assimilated with the existing Negritos; this resulted in the modern Filipino ethnic groups, which display various ratios of genetic admixture between Austronesian and Negrito groups. Jade artifacts have been found dated to 2000 BC, with the lingling-o jade items crafted in Luzon made using raw materials originating from Taiwan. By 1000 BC, the inhabitants of the archipelago had developed into four kinds of social groups: hunter-gatherer tribes, warrior societies, highland plutocracies, and port principalities..",
    "The earliest known surviving written record found in the Philippines is the Laguna Copperplate Inscription. By the 14th century, several of the large coastal settlements had emerged as trading centers and became the focal point of societal changes. Some polities had exchanges with other states across Asia. Trade with China is believed to have begun during the Tang dynasty, and grew more extensive during the Song dynasty; by the second millennium, some polities participated in the tributary system of China. Indian cultural traits, such as linguistic terms and religious practices, began to spread within the Philippines during the 10th century, likely via the Hindu Majapahit Empire. By the 15th century, Islam was established in the Sulu Archipelago and spread from there..",
    "Polities founded in the Philippines from the 10th to the 16th centuries include Maynila, Tondo, Namayan, Pangasinan, Cebu, Butuan, Maguindanao, Lanao, Sulu, and Ma-i. The early polities were typically made up of three-tier social structures: a nobility class, a class of \"freemen\", and a class of dependent debtor-bondsmen. Among the nobility were leaders called datus, responsible for ruling autonomous groups called barangays or dulohan. When these barangays banded together, either to form a larger settlement or a geographically looser alliance, the more esteemed among them would be recognized as a \"paramount datu\", rajah, or sultan which headed the community state. Warfare developed and escalated during the 14th to 16th centuries, and throughout these periods population density is thought to have been low, which was also caused by the frequency of typhoons and the Philippines' location on the Pacific Ring of Fire. In 1521, Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan arrived in the area, claimed the islands for Spain and was then killed by Lapulapu's men at the Battle of Mactan..",
    "Colonization began when Spanish explorer Miguel López de Legazpi arrived from Mexico in 1565.: 20–23  The Spanish forces brought by Legazpi's five ships were a mix of Spaniards and Novohispanics  from New Spain .: 97–98  Many Filipinos were brought back to New Spain as slaves and forced crew. In 1571, Spanish Manila became the capital of the Spanish East Indies, which encompassed Spanish territories in Asia and the Pacific. The Spanish successfully invaded the different local states by employing the principle of divide and conquer, bringing most of what is now the Philippines into a single unified administration. Disparate barangays were deliberately consolidated into towns, where Catholic missionaries were more easily able to convert the inhabitants to Christianity.: 53, 68  From 1565 to 1821, the Philippines was governed as a territory of the Mexico City-based Viceroyalty of New Spain, and later administered from Madrid following the Mexican War of Independence. Manila was the western hub of the trans-Pacific trade. Manila galleons were constructed in Bicol and Cavite..",

    "Cultural developments strengthened the continuing development of a national identity, and Tagalog began to take precedence over other local languages.: 121  Governmental functions were gradually devolved to Filipinos under the Taft Commission and in 1935 the Philippines was granted Commonwealth status with Manuel Quezon as president and Sergio Osmeña as vice president. Quezon's priorities were defence, social justice, inequality and economic diversification, and national character.

Atrocities and war crimes were committed during the war, including the Bataan Death March and the Manila massacre. Allied troops defeated the Japanese in 1945.",
    "It is estimated that over one million Filipinos had died by the end of the war. On October 11, 1945, the Philippines became one of the founding members of the United Nations. On July 4, 1946, the Philippines was officially recognized by the United States as an independent nation through the Treaty of Manila, during the presidency of Manuel Roxas..",
    "The Philippines is an archipelago composed of about 7,640 islands, covering a total area, including inland bodies of water, of around 300,000 square kilometers , with cadastral survey data suggesting it may be larger. The exclusive economic zone of the Philippines covers 2,263,816 km2 . Its 36,289 kilometers  coastline gives it the world's fifth-longest coastline. It is located between 116° 40', and 126° 34' E longitude and 4° 40' and 21° 10' N latitude and is bordered by the Philippine Sea to the east, the South China Sea to the west, and the Celebes Sea to the south. The island of Borneo is located a few hundred kilometers southwest, and Taiwan is located directly to the north.",
    "The highest mountain is Mount Apo, measuring up to 2,954 meters  above sea level and located on the island of Mindanao. Running east of the archipelago, the Philippine Trench extends 10,540-meter  down at the Emden Deep. The longest river is the Cagayan River in northern Luzon, measuring about 520 kilometers . Manila Bay, upon the shore of which the capital city of Manila lies, is connected to Laguna de Bay, the largest lake in the Philippines, by the Pasig River. The Puerto Princesa Subterranean River, which runs 8.2 kilometers  underground through a karst landscape before reaching the ocean, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site..",
    "Situated on the western fringes of the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippines experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity. The Philippine region is seismically active and has been progressively constructed by plates converging towards each other in multiple directions. Around five earthquakes are registered daily, though most are too weak to be sensed. The last major earthquakes were the 1976 Moro Gulf earthquake and the 1990 Luzon earthquake. There are many active volcanoes such as Mayon, Mount Pinatubo, and Taal Volcano. The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991 produced the second largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century. The Philippines is the world's second-biggest geothermal energy producer behind the United States, with 18% of the country's electricity needs being met by geothermal power..",
    "The country has valuable mineral deposits as a result of its complex geologic structure and high level of seismic activity. The Philippines is thought to have the second-largest gold deposits after South Africa, along with a large amount of copper deposits, and the world's largest deposits of palladium. Other minerals include chromite, nickel, and zinc.",
    "The Philippines is a megadiverse country. Eight major types of forests are distributed throughout the Philippines; dipterocarp, beach forest, pine forest, molave forest, lower montane forest, upper montane or mossy forest, mangroves, and ultrabasic forest. As of 2021, the Philippines has 7 million hectares of forest cover, according to official estimates, though experts contend that the actual figure is likely much lower. Deforestation, often the result of illegal logging, is an acute problem in the Philippines.",
    "Forest cover has declined from 70% of the Philippines's total land area in 1900 to about 18.3% in 1999. With an estimated 13,500 plant species in the country, 3,200 of which are unique to the islands, Philippine rainforests have an array of flora, including many rare types of orchids and rafflesia..",
    "Around 1,100 land vertebrate species can be found in the Philippines including over 100 mammal species and 243 bird species not thought to exist elsewhere. The Philippines has among the highest rates of discovery in the world with sixteen new species of mammals discovered in the last ten years.",
    "Because of this, the rate of endemism for the Philippines has risen and likely will continue to rise. Parts of its marine waters contain the highest diversity of shorefish species in the world..",
    "Large reptiles include the Philippine crocodile and saltwater crocodile. The largest crocodile in captivity, known locally as Lolong, was captured in the southern island of Mindanao, and died on February 10, 2013, from pneumonia and cardiac arrest. The national bird, known as the Philippine eagle, has the longest body of any eagle; it generally measures 86 to 102 cm  in length and weighs 4.7 to 8.0 kg . The Philippine eagle is part of the family Accipitridae and is endemic to the rainforests of Luzon, Samar, Leyte, and Mindanao. The Philippines has the third highest number of endemic birds in the world  with 243 endemics."

    "Thus, Murder, She Wrote went into its fifth season that autumn with the distinct possibility that it would cease production at the end of it and the series finale would air in May 1989.",
    "Murder, She Wrote was renewed for a twelfth season after finishing the 1994-95 season as the eighth-most watched program on television, tied with NBC’s new sitcom Friends for the spot.",

    "Meanwhile, CBS decided to go with a new Sunday lineup which consisted of the sophomore sitcom Cybill and the new comedy Almost Perfect replacing Murder, She Wrote in the 8 PM hour.",
    "Ultimately, Murder, She Wrote finished in 58th place in the final ratings and CBS opted not to renew the series for a thirteenth season.",
    "After CBS aired a new episode of Murder, She Wrote on February 25, 1996 that drew nearly 20 million viewers, the show went on a month long hiatus for CBS’ coverage of March Madness.",

  "running": [
    "Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot.",
    "Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground . This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion. A feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride occur simultaneously, with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity. The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting.",
    "Running in humans is associated with improved health and life expectancy..",
    "It is hypothesized that the ancestors of humankind developed the ability to run for long distances about 2.6 million years ago, probably in order to hunt animals. Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas.",
    "Running has been described as the world's most accessible sport..",
    "It is thought that human running evolved at least four and a half million years ago out of the ability of the ape-like Australopithecus, an early ancestor of humans, to walk upright on two legs..",
    "Early humans most likely developed into endurance runners from the practice of persistence hunting of animals, the activity of following and chasing until a prey is too exhausted to flee, succumbing to \"chase myopathy\" , and that human features such as the nuchal ligament, abundant sweat glands, the Achilles tendons, big knee joints and muscular glutei maximi, were changes caused by this type of activity . The theory as first proposed used comparative physiological evidence and the natural habits of animals when running, indicating the likelihood of this activity as a successful hunting method.",
    "Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas such as Greece, Egypt, Asia, and the East African Rift in Africa.",
    "The Tailteann Games, an Irish sporting festival in honor of the goddess Tailtiu, dates back to 1829 BCE, and is one of the earliest records of competitive running. The origins of the Olympics and Marathon running are shrouded by myth and legend, though the first recorded games took place in 776 BCE. Running in Ancient Greece can be traced back to these games of 776 BCE.",
    "Running gait can be divided into two phases in regard to the lower extremity: stance and swing. These can be further divided into absorption, propulsion, initial swing and terminal swing.",
    "Due to the continuous nature of running gait, no certain point is assumed to be the beginning.",
    "However, for simplicity, it will be assumed that absorption and footstrike mark the beginning of the running cycle in a body already in motion.",
    "The propulsion phase of running involves the movement beginning at midstance until toe off. From a full stride length model however, components of the terminal swing and footstrike can aid in propulsion. Set up for propulsion begins at the end of terminal swing as the hip joint flexes, creating the maximal range of motion for the hip extensors to accelerate through and produce force.",
    "The foot then makes contact with the ground with footstrike, completing the running cycle of one side of the lower extremity.",
    "Recent research into various forms of running has focused on the differences, in the potential injury risks and shock absorption capabilities between heel and mid/forefoot footstrikes.",
    "Biomechanical factors associated with elite runners include increased hip function, use and stride length over recreational runners. An increase in running speeds causes increased ground reaction forces and elite distance runners must compensate for this to maintain their pace over long distances. These forces are attenuated through increased stride length via increased hip flexion and extension through decreased ground contact time and more force being used in propulsion. With increased propulsion in the horizontal plane, less impact occurs from decreased force in the vertical plane. Increased hip flexion allows for increased use of the hip extensors through midstance and toe-off, allowing for more force production. The difference even between world-class and national-level 1500-m runners has been associated with more efficient hip joint function. The increase in velocity likely comes from the increased range of motion in hip flexion and extension, allowing for greater acceleration and velocity.",
    "The most common running mistakes are tilting the chin up and scrunching shoulders..",
    "During running, the speed at which the runner moves may be calculated by multiplying the cadence  by the stride length.",
    "Running is often measured in terms of pace, expressed in units of minutes per mile or minutes per kilometer .",
    "Different types of stride are necessary for different types of running.",
    "While there exists the potential for injury while running , there are many benefits.",
    "Some of these benefits include potential weight loss, improved cardiovascular and respiratory health , improved cardiovascular fitness, reduced total blood cholesterol, strengthening of bones , possible strengthening of the immune system and an improved self-esteem and emotional state. Running, like all forms of regular exercise, can effectively slow or reverse the effects of aging.",
    "Even people who have already experienced a heart attack are 20% less likely to develop serious heart problems if more engaged in running or any type of aerobic activity..",
    "Although an optimal amount of vigorous aerobic exercise such as running might bring benefits related to lower cardiovascular disease and life extension, an excessive dose  might have an opposite effect associated with cardiotoxicity..",
    "Running can assist people in losing weight, staying in shape and improving body composition.",
    "Research suggests that the person of average weight will burn approximately 100 calories per mile run. Running increases one's metabolism, even after running; one will continue to burn an increased level of calories for a short time after the run. Different speeds and distances are appropriate for different individual health and fitness levels.",
    "The key is consistency and a slow increase in speed and distance. While running, it is best to pay attention to how one's body feels.",
    "If a runner is gasping for breath or feels exhausted while running, it may be beneficial to slow down or try a shorter distance for a few weeks.",
    "Running can also have psychological benefits, as many participants in the sport report feeling an elated, euphoric state, often referred to as a \"runner's high\". Running is frequently recommended as therapy for people with clinical depression and people coping with addiction. A possible benefit may be the enjoyment of nature and scenery, which also improves psychological well-being .",
    "In animal models, running has been shown to increase the number of newly created neurons within the brain. This finding could have significant implications in aging as well as learning and memory."

    "Insects of this order use only a single pair of wings to fly, the hindwings having evolved into advanced mechanosensory organs known as halteres, which act as high-speed sensors of rotational movement and allow dipterans to perform advanced aerobatics. Diptera is a large order containing an estimated 1,000,000 species including horse-flies, crane flies, hoverflies and others, although only about 125,000 species have been described..",
    "Blowfly larvae, known as gentles, and other dipteran larvae, known more generally as maggots, are used as fishing bait and as food for carnivorous animals.",
    "They belong to the Mecopterida, alongside the Mecoptera, Siphonaptera, Lepidoptera and Trichoptera. The possession of a single pair of wings distinguishes most true flies from other insects with \"fly\" in their names.",
    "Based on the attraction of many modern fly groups to shiny droplets, it has been suggested that they may have fed on honeydew produced by sap-sucking bugs which were abundant at the time, and dipteran mouthparts are well-adapted to softening and lapping up the crusted residues. The basal clades in the Diptera include the Deuterophlebiidae and the enigmatic Nymphomyiidae. Three episodes of evolutionary radiation are thought to have occurred based on the fossil record.",
    "The following cladogram is based on the FLYTREE project..",
    "Many nematoceran larvae are aquatic. There are estimated to be a total of about 19,000 species of Diptera in Europe, 22,000 in the Nearctic region, 20,000 in the Afrotropical region, 23,000 in the Oriental region and 19,000 in the Australasian region. While most species have restricted distributions, a few like the housefly  are cosmopolitan. Gauromydas heros , with a length of up to 7 cm , is generally considered to be the largest fly in the world, while the smallest is Euryplatea nanaknihali, which at 0.4 mm  is smaller than a grain of salt..",
    "The larvae of Megaselia scalaris  are almost omnivorous and consume such substances as paint and shoe polish. The Exorista mella  fly are considered generalists and parasitoids of a variety of hosts. The larvae of the shore flies  and some Chironomidae survive in extreme environments including glaciers , hot springs, geysers, saline pools, sulphur pools, septic tanks and even crude oil . Adult hoverflies  are well known for their mimicry and the larvae adopt diverse lifestyles including being inquiline scavengers inside the nests of social insects. Some brachycerans are agricultural pests, some bite animals and humans and suck their blood, and some transmit diseases..",

    "An example of this is Spilomyia longicornis, which is a fly but mimics a vespid wasp.",
    "For visual course control, flies' optic flow field is analyzed by a set of motion-sensitive neurons. A subset of these neurons is thought to be involved in using the optic flow to estimate the parameters of self-motion, such as yaw, roll, and sideward translation. Other neurons are thought to be involved in analyzing the content of the visual scene itself, such as separating figures from the ground using motion parallax. The H1 neuron is responsible for detecting horizontal motion across the entire visual field of the fly, allowing the fly to generate and guide stabilizing motor corrections midflight with respect to yaw. The ocelli are concerned in the detection of changes in light intensity, enabling the fly to react swiftly to the approach of an object..",
    "In contrast to the flies, the Strepsiptera bear their halteres on the mesothorax and their flight wings on the metathorax. Each of the fly's six legs has a typical insect structure of coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and tarsus, with the tarsus in most instances being subdivided into five tarsomeres. At the tip of the limb is a pair of claws, and between these are cushion-like structures known as pulvilli which provide adhesion..",
    "These act as gyroscopic organs and are rapidly oscillated in time with the wings; they act as a balance and guidance system by providing rapid feedback to the wing-steering muscles, and flies deprived of their halteres are unable to fly.",
    "The wings and halteres move in synchrony but the amplitude of each wing beat is independent, allowing the fly to turn sideways. The wings of the fly are attached to two kinds of muscles, those used to power it and another set used for fine control..",
    "Flies tend to fly in a straight line then make a rapid change in direction before continuing on a different straight path.",
    "They are initiated by visual stimuli as the fly observes an object, nerves then activate steering muscles in the thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient torque to turn.",

In the Mesopotamian versions of the flood myth, the dead corpses floating on the waters are compared to flies. Later, the gods are said to swarm \"like flies\" around the hero Utnapishtim's offering. Flies appear on Old Babylonian seals as symbols of Nergal, the god of death. Fly-shaped lapis lazuli beads were often worn in ancient Mesopotamia, along with other kinds of fly-jewellery..",
    "In a little-known Greek myth, a very chatty and talkative maiden named Myia  enraged the moon-goddess Selene by attempting to seduce her lover, the sleeping Endymion, and was thus turned by the angry goddess into a fly, who now always deprives people of their sleep in memory of her past life. In Prometheus Bound, which is attributed to the Athenian tragic playwright Aeschylus, a gadfly sent by Zeus's wife Hera pursues and torments his mistress Io, who has been transformed into a cow and is watched constantly by the hundred eyes of the herdsman Argus: \"Io: Ah! Hah! Again the prick, the stab of gadfly-sting! O earth, earth, hide, the hollow shape—Argus—that evil thing—the hundred-eyed.\" William Shakespeare, inspired by Aeschylus, has Tom o'Bedlam in King Lear, \"Whom the foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool, o'er bog and quagmire\", driven mad by the constant pursuit. In Antony and Cleopatra, Shakespeare similarly likens Cleopatra's hasty departure from the Actium battlefield to that of a cow chased by a gadfly.

In addition, a number of linguists expert in ancient Celtic have presented compelling evidence that the Tartessian language, once spoken in parts of SW Spain and SW Portugal, is at least proto-Celtic in structure..",
    "Modern archaeology and research shows a Portuguese root to the Celts in Portugal and elsewhere. During that period and until the Roman invasions, the Castro culture  was prolific in Portugal and modern Galicia. This culture, together with the surviving elements of the Atlantic megalithic culture and the contributions that come from the more Western Mediterranean cultures, ended up in what has been called the Cultura Castreja or Castro Culture. This designation refers to the characteristic Celtic populations called 'dùn', 'dùin' or 'don' in Gaelic and that the Romans called castrae in their chronicles..",
    "Based on the Roman chronicles about the Callaeci peoples, along with the Lebor Gabála Érenn narrations and the interpretation of the abundant archaeological remains throughout the northern half of Portugal and Galicia, it is possible to infer that there was a matriarchal society, with a military and religious aristocracy probably of the feudal type. The figures of maximum authority were the chieftain , of military type and with authority in his Castro or clan, and the druid, mainly referring to medical and religious functions that could be common to several castros.",
    "The first documentary references to Castro society are provided by chroniclers of Roman military campaigns such as Strabo, Herodotus and Pliny the Elder among others, about the social organization, and describing the inhabitants of these territories, the Gallaeci of Northern Portugal as:.",
    "There were other similar tribes, and chief among them were the Lusitanians; the core area of these people lay in inland central Portugal, while numerous other related tribes existed such as the Celtici of Alentejo, and the Cynetes or Conii of the Algarve.",
    "The Roman conquest of what is now part of Portugal took almost two hundred years and took many lives of young soldiers and the lives of those who were sentenced to a certain death in the slave mines when not sold as slaves to other parts of the empire.",
    "Later, a northern province of Lusitania was formed, known as Gallaecia, with capital in Bracara Augusta, today's Braga. There are still many ruins of castros  throughout modern Portugal and remains of the Castro culture.",
    "The former, beyond being one of the largest Roman settlements in Portugal, is also classified as a National Monument.",
    "From the various Germanic groups who settled in western Iberia, the Suebi left the strongest lasting cultural legacy in what is today Portugal, Galicia and western fringes of Asturias. According to Dan Stanislawski, the Portuguese way of living in regions North of the Tagus is mostly inherited from the Suebi, in which small farms prevail, distinct from the large properties of Southern Portugal.",
    "Bracara Augusta, the modern city of Braga and former capital of Gallaecia, became the capital of the Suebi. Apart from cultural and some linguistic traces, the Suebians left the highest Germanic genetic contribution of the Iberian Peninsula in Portugal and Galicia. Orosius, at that time resident in Hispania, shows a rather pacific initial settlement, the newcomers working their lands or serving as bodyguards of the locals. Another Germanic group that accompanied the Suebi and settled in Gallaecia were the Buri.",
    "Today's continental Portugal, along with most of modern Spain, was part of al-Andalus between 726 and 1249, following the Umayyad Caliphate conquest of the Iberian Peninsula.",
    "Beginning in 726, the land that is now Portugal became part of the vast Umayyad Caliphate's empire of Damascus, which stretched from the Indus river in the Indian sub-continent up to the South of France, until its collapse in 750.",
    "Most of present-day Portugal fell into the hands of the Taifa of Badajoz of the Aftasid Dynasty, and after a short spell of an ephemeral Taifa of Lisbon in 1022, fell under the dominion of the Taifa of Seville of the Abbadids poets.",
    "The main cities of the period in Portugal were in the southern half of the country: Beja, Silves, Alcácer do Sal, Santarém and Lisbon."

    "Agriculture has been the major economic feature of the Punjab and has therefore formed the foundation of Punjabi culture, with one's social status being determined by land ownership. The Punjab emerged as an important agricultural region, especially following the Green Revolution during the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, and has been described as the \"breadbasket of both India and Pakistan.\".",

The Vardhana empire who conquered the Alchon Huns and North India. The Punjab is also responsible for the Tughlaq and Sayyid empires which formed two of the Delhi sultanate dynasties. The Eastern Punjab republics in Ancient Punjab  are also accredited for the establishment of the Mauryan empire and the defeat of many foreign forces that entered Punjab, for example the Indo-Greek Kingdom and the Kushan Empire..",
    "The boundaries of the region are ill-defined and focus on historical accounts and thus the geographical definition of the term \"Punjab\" has changed over time.",

    "The chemosensory basis for detecting sweetness, which varies between both individuals and species, has only begun to be understood since the late 20th century.",

Sweetness appears to have the highest taste recognition threshold, being detectable at around 1 part in 200 of sucrose in solution.",
    "By comparison, bitterness appears to have the lowest detection threshold, at about 1 part in 2 million for quinine in solution. In the natural settings that human primate ancestors evolved in, sweetness intensity should indicate energy density, while bitterness tends to indicate toxicity. The high sweetness detection threshold and low bitterness detection threshold would have predisposed our primate ancestors to seek out sweet-tasting  foods and avoid bitter-tasting foods.",
    "Even amongst leaf-eating primates, there is a tendency to prefer immature leaves, which tend to be higher in protein and lower in fibre and poisons than mature leaves. The 'sweet tooth' thus has an ancient heritage, and while food processing has changed consumption patterns, human physiology remains largely unchanged..",

The concept is often synonymous to consciousness and is also understood as being consciousness itself..",
    "The states of awareness are also associated with the states of experience so that the structure represented in awareness is mirrored in the structure of experience..",
    "Awareness is a relative concept.",
    "It may be focused on an internal state, such as a visceral feeling, or on external events by way of sensory perception. It is analogous to sensing something, a process distinguished from observing and perceiving . Awareness or \"to sense\" can be described as something that occurs when the brain is activated in certain ways, such as when the color red is what is seen once the retina is stimulated by light waves. This conceptualization is posited amid the difficulty in developing an analytic definition of awareness or sensory awareness..",
    "Awareness is also associated with consciousness in the sense that this concept denotes a fundamental experience such as a feeling or intuition that accompanies the experience of phenomena. Specifically, this is referred to as awareness of experience.",
    "Peripheral awareness refers to the human ability to process information at the periphery of attention, such as when we acknowledge the distant sounds of people outside while we sit indoors and concentrate on writing a report..",

Modern systems theory, which offers insights into how the world works through an understanding that all systems follow system rules, approach self-awareness within its understanding of how large complex living systems work.",
    "According to Gregory Bateson, the mind is the dynamics of self-organization and that awareness is crucial in the existence of this process. Modern systems theory maintains that humans, as living systems, have not only awareness of their environment but also self-awareness particularly with their capability for logic and curiosity..",
    "Efforts to describe consciousness in neurological terms have focused on describing networks in the brain that develop awareness of the qualia developed by other networks. As awareness provides the materials from which one develops subjective ideas about their experience, it is said that one is aware of one's own awareness state. This organization of awareness of one's own inner experience is given a central role in self-regulation..",
    "Neural systems that regulate attention serve to attenuate awareness among complex animals whose central and peripheral nervous systems provide more information than cognitive areas of the brain can assimilate.",

    "This theory contributes a perspective that cognition is a process present at organic levels that we do not usually consider to be aware.",
    "Given the possible relationship between awareness and cognition, and consciousness, this theory contributes an interesting perspective in the philosophical and scientific dialogue of awareness and living systems theory..",
    "In cooperative settings, awareness is a term used to denote \"knowledge created through the interaction of an agent and its environment — in simple terms 'knowing what is going on'\". In this setting, awareness is meant to convey how individuals monitor and perceive the information surrounding their colleagues and the environment they are in.",

For example, changes to the natural water cycle have been predicted and observed, such as an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, melting of snow and land ice, and increased atmospheric humidity. Flora and fauna are also behaving in a manner consistent with warming; for instance, plants are flowering earlier in spring. Another key indicator is the cooling of the upper atmosphere, which demonstrates that greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the Earth's surface and preventing it from radiating into space..",
    "Since the pre-industrial period, the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global-average surface temperature. This is because of the larger heat capacity of oceans, and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation.

The rest has heated the atmosphere, melted ice, and warmed the continents.."

Memphis, the capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom and a major city up until the Ptolemaic period, was located a short distance south of present-day Cairo. Heliopolis, another important city and major religious center, was located in what are now the northeastern suburbs of Cairo.

Between 1087 and 1092 Badr al-Gamali also rebuilt the city walls in stone and constructed the city gates of Bab al-Futuh, Bab al-Nasr, and Bab Zuweila that still stand today..",

    "While the Crusaders did not capture the city in 1168, a continuing power struggle between Shawar, King Amalric, and the Zengid general Shirkuh led to the downfall of the Fatimid establishment. In 1169, Shirkuh's nephew Saladin was appointed as the new vizier of Egypt by the Fatimids and two years later he seized power from the family of the last Fatimid caliph, al-'Āḍid. As the first Sultan of Egypt, Saladin established the Ayyubid dynasty, based in Cairo, and aligned Egypt with the Sunni Abbasids, who were based in Baghdad. In 1176, Saladin began construction on the Cairo Citadel, which was to serve as the seat of the Egyptian government until the mid-19th century.",
    "The construction of the Citadel definitively ended Fatimid-built Cairo's status as an exclusive palace-city and opened it up to common Egyptians and to foreign merchants, spurring its commercial development. Along with the Citadel, Saladin also began the construction of a new 20-kilometre-long wall that would protect both Cairo and Fustat on their eastern side and connect them with the new Citadel.",
    "Despite their military character, the Mamluks were also prolific builders and left a rich architectural legacy throughout Cairo. Continuing a practice started by the Ayyubids, much of the land occupied by former Fatimid palaces was sold and replaced by newer buildings, becoming a prestigious site for the construction of Mamluk religious and funerary complexes. Construction projects initiated by the Mamluks pushed the city outward while also bringing new infrastructure to the centre of the city. Meanwhile, Cairo flourished as a centre of Islamic scholarship and a crossroads on the spice trade route among the civilisations in Afro-Eurasia. Under the reign of the Mamluk sultan al-Nasir Muhammad , Cairo reached its apogee in terms of population and wealth. By 1340, Cairo had a population of close to half a million, making it the largest city west of China..",

Although Cairo avoided Europe's stagnation during the Late Middle Ages, it could not escape the Black Death, which struck the city more than fifty times between 1348 and 1517. During its initial, and most deadly waves, approximately 200,000 people were killed by the plague, and, by the 15th century, Cairo's population had been reduced to between 150,000 and 300,000. The population decline was accompanied by a period of political instability between 1348 and 1412.",

    "Wealthy suburbs in Lusaka include Woodlands, Ibex Hill and Rhodes Park.",
    "The earliest evidence of settlement in the area around what is now the Lusaka area dates to the 6th century.",
    "The subsequent centuries saw considerable fluctuation of people in the area, until the arrival of the Lenje and Soli peoples in the 17th or 18th century. The Soli are believed by scholars to have arrived as part of the Luba migration along the Luapula River, while the Lenje are related to the Ila–Tonga. Modern Lusaka lies on the boundary of the territories of the two groups, with the Lenje inhabiting the region to the north of the city and the Soli to the south. In the 19th century, African and European slave traders began arriving from the coastal regions of modern-day Tanzania, Mozambique and Angola, enslaving members of the Soli and Lenje communities for shipment to the Middle East, Europe and South America. The need to evade these attacks as well as their use of a shifting-cultivation farming system, necessitated frequent relocation amongst the Soli and Lenje, and there were, therefore, no major permanent settlements..",
    "In the late 19th century, British–South African mining entrepreneur and politician Cecil Rhodes founded the British South African Company , with a charter from Queen Victoria to colonise and develop land in sections of what is now northern South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi and Botswana. Rhodes was a strong believer in the Cape to Cairo railway project, although with German East Africa blocking the route to the north of BSAC territory, he could not progress it during his lifetime. With little regard for the human rights of the African populations, Rhodes personally led the conquest of territory as far as Salisbury , and his company continued extending to the north even after his death in 1902. The BSAC took formal control of the region around Lusaka through the protectorate of Barotziland–North-Western Rhodesia, named after Rhodes, in 1899. The capital was initially at Kalomo, being switched to Livingstone in 1907. This was merged in 1911 with the territory of North-Eastern Rhodesia to form Northern Rhodesia, predecessor of modern Zambia..",
    "Faced with uprisings by Africans within their territory, as well as an economic decline and a desire to expand mining interests in northern Zambia's Copperbelt, the BSAC expedited the building of the northbound railway from South Africa into Northern Rhodesia from 1896. Lusaka was founded in 1905 as a water stop on the route and was named after a Chief Lusaaka, the leader of a nearby Lenje village. The section of line through Lusaka was built by the Mashonaland Railway Company, extending the line by 452 kilometres  from Kalomo through to the mining town of Broken Hill . During the subsequent years, white Afrikaner farmers settled in the area, Lusaka becoming their regional centre and access point to the railway.",
    "By 1913, several stores and a hotel had opened, and they persuaded the BSAC to declare Lusaka as a recognised town and cede control of local affairs to them. This early town was governed by the Lusaka Village Management Board, elected by the farmers, and consisted of a tract of land along the railway route, 5 kilometres  in length and 1.5 kilometres  wide..",
    "This created an almost continuous line of British colonies from South Africa through to Egypt and led to the revival of projects for the Cape to Cairo railway and a similar road route. The British imperial government took direct control of Northern Rhodesia in 1924, through a governor and legislative council, but the BSAC retained its rights over mining acquired in prior decades. The new administration favoured an indirect rule system with self-governance for the African population, although in reality the rights of Africans remained very limited. The mining corporations, as well as Afrikaner farmers around Lusaka, did not welcome the change, favouring a South African model. The colonial administration favoured the establishment of planned towns as a means of asserting its authority..",
    "Maxwell and Alexander then investigated possible sites for the new city, eventually choosing Lusaka as a result of its situation on the railway and at the crossroads of Northern Rhodesia's Great North Road and Great East Road. Maxwell requested a town planner from the Colonial Office, which sent University College London professor Stanley Adshead, as well as a water engineer, to the colony.",
    "Adshead examined several possible locations for the capital, eventually confirming Lusaka as a suitable location in late 1930.",
    "He had considered placing the capital in the Copperbelt, but a mutual distrust between the mining corporations and the government meant that both preferred to maintain some distance between the capital and the mines. The water engineer's investigations concluded that there was sufficient groundwater, and the report confirming Lusaka as the planned capital was approved by the legislative council in July 1931..",
    "Ronald Storrs replaced Maxwell as governor in 1932, but funds were limited as a result of the Great Depression and there was little progress on the development of Lusaka.",
    "The £43,000 projected cost of the building was more than 10 per cent of the total budget earmarked for the Lusaka project and the Colonial Office insisted in late 1933 that it be reduced.",
    "Early in his tenure, in April 1934, Young hosted a visit to Lusaka by Prince George, the fourth son of King George V. During his visit, George laid the foundation stone of Lusaka's administrative buildings, as well as opening roads named after his father and himself. After the royal visit, Young wrote to the Colonial Office that he was \"optimistic about the future of Lusaka\", and he appointed administrator Eric Dutton to lead the project. There was some resistance from the white population of Livingstone, which feared that the capital would lead to a loss of business.",
    "Lusaka formally became the capital in May 1935, with a \"Lusaka week\" celebration scheduled to coincide with celebrations of George V's silver jubilee.",
    "The government commissioned a special train, which moved all government officials from Livingstone to Lusaka during a single weekend..",
    "Under Adshead's original plans, Lusaka was proposed as a pure administrative centre, with no industry or large African population; he commented at one point that it \"could never become an important city\". Under Bowling's revised plans, there were areas designated for both light and heavy industry, as well as a business area. He gave prominence to the airport, as well as to the government house, albeit under a simpler design than that envisaged by Storrs.",
    "Despite producing these plans, both Adshead and Bowling had left Rhodesia before the Lusaka week, and the remainder of the building was left to Dutton and a small team of white officials. The city's footprint covered a large area, even at this early stage, despite much of it being undeveloped.",
    "The building of Lusaka continued through the second half of the 1930s, but progress was slowed by a shortage of funds.",
    "The loan taken to cover the project's £400,000 budget was guaranteed by the Beit Trust, but there was no scope for additional infrastructure to be built. The UK launched an investigation into a possible merger of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1938, a prospect which caused private businesses to withdraw investment, fearing that Lusaka would lose its capital status.",
    "This concluded that despite the relatively high taxes on mining in the territory, the administration  was not getting its fair share. Pim also criticised the allocation of housing for Africans in Lusaka, noting that of 10,000 living in the city at that time, only 1,500 were in formal housing. Africans were at that time only permitted to live in the city under temporary work permits, with family members required to remain elsewhere..",
    "The need for metals during World War II led to a boom in the copper industry which, accompanied by a 1941 excess-profits tax ordered by the UK, brought increased revenue to the government. The boom also led to a substantial increase in urbanisation. Lusaka's official population  rose from around 2,000 in 1931 to almost 19,000 in 1946, with a 15 per cent annual growth rate. In 1948, the government passed the African Housing Ordinance, which authorised permanent residential suburbs for Africans, including married couples.",
    "Lusaka's African workforce, which remained relatively unskilled, did not benefit as much as that of the Copperbelt, where a shortage of skilled mining labour had led to improved pay. In 1952, a development plan for Lusaka gained statutory approval for the first time – earlier proposals such as those by Adshead and Bowling had never been legally sanctioned. This plan envisaged much more territory for the African suburbs, but only around one-third of these were ever built..",
    "The federation was popular with white settlers across the region, especially in Southern Rhodesia, but was strongly opposed by the African population. Lusaka remained the capital of Northern Rhodesia but many of the government departments, as well as some private sector industries, moved to Salisbury, which was designated as the federal capital."

    "A stepmother-in-law is a stepmother of one's spouse.",
    "Stepparents  may also face some societal challenges due to the stigma surrounding the \"evil stepmother\" character.",
    "Morello notes that the introduction of the \"evil stepmother\" character in the past is problematic to stepparents today, as it has created a stigma towards stepmothers. The presence of this stigma can have a negative impact on stepmothers' self-esteem..",
    "In fiction, stepmothers are often portrayed as being wicked and evil. The character of the wicked stepmother features heavily in fairy tales; the most famous examples are Cinderella, Snow White and Hansel and Gretel.",
    "Stepdaughters are her most common victim, and then stepdaughter/stepson pairs, but stepsons also are victims as in The Juniper Tree—sometimes, as in East of the Sun and West of the Moon, because he refused to marry his stepsister as she wished, or, indeed, they may make their stepdaughters-in-law their victims, as in The Boys with the Golden Stars. In some fairy tales, such as Giambattista Basile's La Gatta Cennerentola or the Danish Green Knight, the stepmother wins the marriage by ingratiating herself with the stepdaughter, and once she obtains it, becomes cruel..",
    "In some fairy tales, the stepdaughter's escape by marrying does not free her from her stepmother.",
    "After the birth of the stepdaughter's first child, the stepmother may attempt to murder the new mother and replace her with her own daughter—thus making her the stepmother to the next generation.",
    "Such a replacement occurs in The Wonderful Birch, Brother and Sister, and The Three Little Men in the Wood; only by foiling the stepmother's plot , is the story brought to a happy ending. In the Korean Folktale Janghwa Hongryeon jeon, the stepmother kills her own stepdaughters.",
    "In many stories with evil stepmothers, the hostility between the stepmother and the stepchild is underscored by having the child succeed through aid from the dead mother. This motif occurs from Norse mythology, where Svipdagr rouses his mother Gróa from the grave so as to learn from her how to accomplish a task his stepmother set, to fairy tales such as the Brothers Grimm version of Cinderella, where Aschenputtel receives her clothing from a tree growing on her mother's grave, the Russian Vasilissa the Beautiful, where Vasilissa is aided by a doll her mother gave, and her mother's blessing, and the Malay Bawang Putih Bawang Merah, where the heroine's mother comes back as fish to protect her.",
    "The notion of the word stepmother being descriptive of an intrinsically unkind parent is suggested by peculiar wording in John Gamble's \"An Irish Wake\" .",
    "Fairy tales can have variants where one tale has an evil mother and the other an evil stepmother: in The Six Swans by the Brothers Grimm and also in The Wild Swans by Hans Christian Andersen, the heroine is persecuted by her husband's mother and in another one by her stepmother, and in The Twelve Wild Ducks, by his stepmother.",
    "Sometimes this appears to be a deliberate switch: The Brothers Grimm, having put in their first editions versions of Snow White and Hansel and Gretel where the villain was the biological mother, altered it to a stepmother in later editions, perhaps to mitigate the story's violence. Another reason for the change from a villainous mother to a villainous stepmother may have been the belief that mothers were sacred, as well as the belief that people would not believe that a mother could harbor such ill-will and animosity toward their child. The Icelandic fairy tale The Horse Gullfaxi and the Sword Gunnfoder features a good stepmother, who indeed aids the prince like a fairy godmother, but this figure is very rare in fairy tales.",
    "The stepmother may be identified with other evils the characters meet.",
    "For instance, both the stepmother and the witch in Hansel and Gretel are deeply concerned with food, the stepmother to avoid hunger, the witch with her house built of food and her desire to eat the children, and when the children kill the witch and return home, their stepmother has mysteriously died..",
    "This hostility from the stepmother and tenderness from the true mother has been interpreted in varying ways.",
    "A psychological interpretation, by Bruno Bettelheim, describes it as \"splitting\" the actual mother in an ideal mother and a false mother that contains what the child dislikes in the actual mother. However, historically, many women died in childbirth, their husbands remarried, and the new stepmothers competed with the children of the first marriage for resources; the tales can be interpreted as factual conflicts from history. In some fairy tales, such as The Juniper Tree, the stepmother's hostility is overtly the desire to secure the inheritance of her children..",
    "Stepmothers also make many appearances in Chinese tales of family.",
    "Wicked stepmothers are common. In Classic of Filial Piety, Guo Jujing told the story of Min Ziqian, who had lost his mother at a young age.",
    "His stepmother had two more sons and saw to it that they were warmly dressed in winter but neglected her stepson.",
    "His father relented, and the stepmother henceforth took care of all three children.",
    "Conversely, the exemplary stepmother prefers the stepson to her own child, in recognition that his seniority makes him superior. The \"righteous stepmother of Qi\", faced with her son and stepson having been found by a murdered man, and both having confessed to shield the other, argues for her son's execution because her husband had ordered her to look after her stepson, and her son is the junior brother; the king pardoned them both for her devotion to duty..",
    "The ubiquity of the wicked stepmother has made it a frequent theme of revisionist fairy tale fantasy.",
    "This can range from Tanith Lee's Red as Blood, where the stepmother queen is desperately trying to protect the land from her evil stepdaughter's magic, to Diana Wynne Jones's Howl's Moving Castle, where, although it is known that stepmothers are evil, the actual stepmother is guilty of nothing more than some carelessness, to Erma Bombeck's retelling where Cinderella is lazy and a liar.",

    "But Threnody explains that her presence at the castle caused her father to dote on her and neglect his duties to the destruction of the kingdom; her stepmother had merely made her destructive potential literal, and forced her to confront what she was doing..",

    "The first European visitor to New Zealand, Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, named the islands Staten Land, believing they were part of the Staten Landt that Jacob Le Maire had sighted off the southern end of South America. Hendrik Brouwer proved that the South American land was a small island in 1643, and Dutch cartographers subsequently renamed Tasman's discovery Nova Zeelandia from Latin, after the Dutch province of Zeeland. This name was later anglicised to New Zealand..",
    "In 1834 a document written in Māori and entitled \"He Wakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga o Nu Tireni\" was translated into English and became the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand.",
    "It was prepared by Te Wakaminenga o Nga Rangatiratanga o Nga Hapu o Nu Tireni, the United Tribes of New Zealand, and a copy was sent to King William IV who had already acknowledged the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand, and who recognised the declaration in a letter from Lord Glenelg..",
    "Aotearoa  is the current Māori name for New Zealand.",
    "It is unknown whether Māori had a name for the whole country before the arrival of Europeans; Aotearoa originally referred to just the North Island. Māori had several traditional names for the two main islands, including Te Ika-a-Māui  for the North Island and Te Waipounamu  or Te Waka o Aoraki  for the South Island. Early European maps labelled the islands North , Middle , and South . In 1830, mapmakers began to use \"North\" and \"South\" on their maps to distinguish the two largest islands, and by 1907, this was the accepted norm. The New Zealand Geographic Board discovered in 2009 that the names of the North Island and South Island had never been formalised, and names and alternative names were formalised in 2013.",
    "This set the names as North Island or Te Ika-a-Māui, and South Island or Te Waipounamu. For each island, either its English or Māori name can be used, or both can be used together. Similarly the Māori and English names for the whole country are sometimes used together ; however, this has no official recognition..",
    "New Zealand is one of the last major landmasses settled by humans.",
    "Radiocarbon dating, evidence of deforestation and mitochondrial DNA variability within Māori populations suggest that Eastern Polynesians first settled the New Zealand archipelago between 1250 and 1300, although newer archaeological and genetic research points to a date no earlier than about 1280, with at least the main settlement period between about 1320 and 1350, consistent with evidence based on genealogical traditions. This represented a culmination in a long series of voyages through the Pacific islands. Over the centuries that followed, the Polynesian settlers developed a distinct culture now known as Māori.",
    "In a hostile 1642 encounter between Ngāti Tūmatakōkiri and Dutch explorer Abel Tasman's crew, four of Tasman's crew members were killed, and at least one Māori was hit by canister shot. Europeans did not revisit New Zealand until 1769, when British explorer James Cook mapped almost the entire coastline. Following Cook, New Zealand was visited by numerous European and North American whaling, sealing, and trading ships.",
    "Potatoes provided a reliable food surplus, which enabled longer and more sustained military campaigns. The resulting intertribal Musket Wars encompassed over 600 battles between 1801 and 1840, killing 30,000–40,000 Māori. From the early 19th century, Christian missionaries began to settle New Zealand, eventually converting most of the Māori population. The Māori population declined to around 40% of its pre-contact level during the 19th century; introduced diseases were the major factor..",
    "The British Government appointed James Busby as British Resident to New Zealand in 1832 following a petition from northern Māori. His duties were to protect British commerce, mediate between the unruly Pākehā  settlers and Māori, and to apprehend escaped convicts. In 1835, following an announcement of impending French settlement by Charles de Thierry, the nebulous United Tribes of New Zealand sent a Declaration of Independence to King William IV of the United Kingdom asking for protection. Ongoing unrest, the proposed settlement of New Zealand by the New Zealand Company  and the dubious legal standing of the Declaration of Independence prompted the Colonial Office to send Captain William Hobson to claim sovereignty for the United Kingdom and negotiate a treaty with the Māori. The Treaty of Waitangi was first signed in the Bay of Islands on 6 February 1840. In response to the New Zealand Company's attempts to establish an independent settlement in Wellington and French settlers purchasing land in Akaroa, Hobson declared British sovereignty over all of New Zealand on 21 May 1840, even though copies of the treaty were still circulating throughout the country for Māori to sign. With the signing of the treaty and declaration of sovereignty, the number of immigrants, particularly from the United Kingdom, began to increase..",
    "New Zealand was administered as part of the Colony of New South Wales until becoming a separate Crown colony, the Colony of New Zealand on 3 May 1841. Armed conflict began between the colonial government and Māori in 1843 with the Wairau Affray over land and disagreements over sovereignty.",
    "These conflicts, mainly in the North Island, saw thousands of imperial troops and the Royal Navy come to New Zealand and became known as the New Zealand Wars."

    "Most blades were made of steel . In the mid 18th century a superior form of completely melted steel  began to be made in Sheffield, England, and this rapidly became the preferred material, due to its hardness, ductility, springiness and ability to take a fine polish. A small saw industry survived in London and Birmingham, but by the 1820s the industry was growing rapidly and increasingly concentrated in Sheffield, which remained the largest centre of production, with over 50% of the nation's saw makers. The US industry began to overtake it in the last decades of the century, due to superior mechanisation, better marketing, a large domestic market, and the imposition of high tariffs on imports. Highly productive industries continued in Germany and France.",
    "Early European saws were made from a heated sheet of iron or steel, produced by flattening by several men simultaneously hammering on an anvil. After cooling, the teeth were punched out one at a time with a die, the size varying with the size of the saw.",
    "The industry gradually mechanized all the processes, including the important grinding the saw plate \"thin to the back\" by a fraction of an inch, which helped the saw to pass through the kerf without binding. The use of steel added the need to harden and temper the saw plate, to grind it flat, to smith it by hand hammering and ensure the springiness and resistance to bending deformity, and finally to polish it. Most hand saws are today entirely made without human intervention, with the steel plate supplied ready rolled to thickness and tensioned before being cut to shape by laser.",

    "In the Middle Ages, more settlements began near modern-day Dushanbe such as Hulbuk and its famous palace.",

    "Dushanbe was captured by the Bolsheviks in 1922, and the town was made the capital of the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1924, which commenced Dushanbe's development and rapid population growth that continued until the Tajik Civil War.",

    "Parks and main sights of the city include Victory Park, Rudaki Park, the Tajikistan National Museum, the Dushanbe Flagpole, and the Tajikistan National Museum of Antiquities.",
    "Dushanbe was the location of a large bazaar that operated on Mondays. This gave rise to the name Dushanbe-Bazar  from Dushanbe, which means Monday in the Persian language – literally, the second day  following Saturday . Its previous name was Stalinabad , but renamed as a result of de-Stalinization..",
    "In the Stone Age, Mousterian tool-users inhabited the Gissar Valley near modern-day Dushanbe. The Gissar culture, whose stone tools were discovered within modern-day Dushanbe at the confluence of the Varzob and Luchob, Bishkent culture, and Vakhsh culture all were thought to have inhabited the valley in the second millennium BC, during the Neolithic period, and were primarily involved in cattle breeding, agriculture, and weaving..",

The Kharakhanids minted coins from 1018 to 1019 found in the city. The city came under the influence of the Ghurids from the 12th to 13th centuries..",

    "In the unstable environment of Russian intervention and local revolts, Bukhara took over the Dushanbe region, control over which the Emirate was able to sustain through the gradual establishment of a Russian-influenced centralized state. The first hospital in the village was constructed in 1915 by Russian investment and an early railroad was proposed to connect the market town with the Russian railway system in 1909, but was abandoned after a review determined the venture would not be profitable, although the town did have a functioning railroad to Kagan..",
    "In 1920, the last Emir of Bukhara briefly took refuge in Dushanbe after being overthrown by the Bolshevik revolution.",

In February 1922, the town was taken by Basmachi troops led by Enver Pasha after a siege, but on 14 July 1922 again came under the power of the Bolsheviks soon before the death of Enver Pasha on 4 August 1922 outside of Dushanbe. It was a part of the Bukharan PSR until the formation of the Tajik ASSR..",

How come you got so many kids?\" Gilbreth would pretend to ponder the question carefully, and then, just as the light turned green, would say: \"Well, they come cheaper by the dozen, you know\", and drive off.",

    "Swedish territories outside the Scandinavian Peninsula were gradually lost during the 18th and 19th centuries, ending with the annexation of present-day Finland by Russia in 1809.",
    "The name for Sweden is generally agreed to derive from the Proto-Indo-European root *se, meaning \"one's own\", referring to one's own tribe from the tribal period. The native Swedish name, Sverige , translates as \"realm of the Swedes\", which excluded the Geats in Götaland.",
    "As for literacy in Sweden itself, the runic script was in use among the south Scandinavian elite by at least the second century AD, but all that has come down to the present from the Roman Period is curt inscriptions on artefacts, mainly of male names, demonstrating that the people of south Scandinavia spoke Proto-Norse at the time, a language ancestral to Swedish and other North Germanic languages..",

The Swedish colonisation of the coastal areas of Finland also started during the 12th and 13th century. In the 14th century, the colonisation began to be more organised, and by the end of the century, several of the coastal areas of Finland were inhabited mostly by Swedes..",
    "Except for the provinces of Scania, Blekinge and Halland in the south-west of the Scandinavian peninsula, which were parts of the Kingdom of Denmark during this time, feudalism never developed in Sweden as it did in the rest of Europe.

    "Sweden reached its largest territorial extent under the rule of Charles X after the treaty of Roskilde in 1658, following Charles X's risky but successful crossing of the Danish Belts. The foundation of Sweden's success during this period is credited to Gustav I's major changes to the Swedish economy in the 16th century, and his introduction of Protestantism. In the 17th century, Sweden was engaged in many wars, for example with Poland–Lithuania, with both sides competing for territories of today's Baltic states, with Sweden suffering a notable defeat at the Battle of Kircholm. One-third of the Finnish population died in the devastating Great Famine of 1695–1697 that struck the country. Famine also hit Sweden, killing roughly 10% of Sweden's population..",

    "After the success of invading Poland, Charles XII decided to make an attempt at invading Russia, but this ended in a decisive Russian victory at the Battle of Poltava in 1709. After a long march exposed to Cossack raids, the Russian Tsar Peter the Great's scorched-earth techniques and the extremely cold winter of 1709, the Swedes stood weakened with a shattered morale and were enormously outnumbered against the Russian army at Poltava. The defeat meant the beginning of the end for the Swedish Empire."

    "elephants, rhinos, and mole-rats), do not use thermal sweat glands in cooling. Pigs are also less able than many other mammals to dissipate heat from wet mucous membranes in the mouth through panting.",
    "Their thermoneutral zone is 16 to 22 °C . At higher temperatures, pigs lose heat by wallowing in mud or water via evaporative cooling, although it has been suggested that wallowing may serve other functions, such as protection from sunburn, ecto-parasite control, and scent-marking..",
    "Pigs are one of four known mammalian species which possess mutations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that protect against snake venom.",
    "Mongooses, honey badgers, hedgehogs, and pigs all have modifications to the receptor pocket which prevents the snake venom α-neurotoxin from binding.",
    "Pigs have small lungs in relation to their body size, and are thus more susceptible than other domesticated animals to fatal bronchitis and pneumonia. Pigs have a maximum life span of about 27 years..",
    "Archaeological evidence suggests that pigs were domesticated from wild boar in the Near East in the Tigris Basin, Çayönü, Cafer Höyük, Nevalı Çori being managed in the wild in a way similar to the way they are managed by some modern New Guineans. Remains of pigs have been dated to earlier than 11,400 years ago in Cyprus.",
    "Those animals must have been introduced from the mainland, which suggests domestication in the adjacent mainland by then. Pigs were separately domesticated in China beginning 8,000 years ago, and have been one of the most important domesticated animal there ever since..",
    "DNA evidence from subfossil remains of teeth and jawbones of Neolithic pigs shows that the first domestic pigs in Europe had been brought from the Near East.",
    "Modern domesticated pigs have involved complex exchanges, with European domesticated lines being exported, in turn, to the ancient Near East. Historical records indicate that Asian pigs were introduced into Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries..",
    "The study indicated that pigs were domesticated separately in Western Asia and China, with Western Asian pigs introduced into Europe, where they crossed with wild boar.",
    "A model that fit the data included a mixture with a now extinct ghost population of wild pigs during the Pleistocene.",
    "The study also found that despite back-crossing with wild pigs, the genomes of domestic pigs have strong signatures of selection at DNA loci that affect behavior and morphology.",
    "Among the animals that the Spanish introduced to the Chiloé Archipelago in the 16th century, pigs were the most successful to adapt.",
    "The pigs benefited from abundant shellfish and algae exposed by the large tides of the archipelago. Pigs were brought to southeastern North America from Europe by de Soto and other early Spanish explorers.",
    "Escaped pigs became feral and caused a great deal of disruption to Native Americans. Feral pig populations in the southeastern United States have since migrated north and are a growing concern in the Midwest.",
    "Considered an invasive species, many state agencies have programs to trap or hunt feral pigs as means of removal. Domestic pigs have become feral in many other parts of the world (e.g.",
    "Female pigs reach sexual maturity at 3–12 months of age and come into estrus every 18–24 days if they are not successfully bred.",
    "Androstenol is one of the pheromones produced in the submaxillary salivary glands of boars that will trigger the female's response. The female cervix contains a series of five interdigitating pads, or folds, that will hold the boar's corkscrew-shaped penis during copulation. Females have bicornuate uteruses and two conceptuses must be present in both uterine horns for pregnancy to be established. Maternal recognition of pregnancy in pigs occurs on days 11 to 12 of pregnancy and is marked by progesterone production from a functioning corpus luteum . To avoid luteolysis by PGF2α, rescuing of the CL must occur via embryonic signaling of estradiol 17β and PGE2. This signaling acts on both the endometrium and luteal tissue to prevent the regression of the CL by activation of genes that are responsible for CL maintenance. During mid to late pregnancy, the CL relies primarily on luteinizing hormone  for maintenance until parturition. Animal nutrition is important prior to reproduction and during gestation to ensure optimum reproductive performance is achieved..",
    "Archeological evidence indicates that medieval European pigs farrowed, or bore a litter of piglets, once per year. By the nineteenth century, European piglets routinely double-farrowed, or bore two litters of piglets per year.",
    "In many ways pig behaviour appears to be intermediate between that of other artiodactyls and of carnivores. Pigs seek out the company of other pigs and often huddle to maintain physical contact, although they do not naturally form large herds.",
    "Because of their relative lack of sweat glands, pigs often control their body temperature using behavioural thermoregulation."

    "Caracas has some of the tallest skyscrapers in Latin America, such as the Parque Central Towers. The Museum of Contemporary Art of Caracas is one of the most important in South America..",
    "Before the city was founded in 1567, the valley of Caracas was populated by indigenous peoples.",
    "Francisco Fajardo, the son of a Spanish captain and a Guaiqueri cacica, who came from Margarita, began establishing settlements in the area of La Guaira and the Caracas valley between 1555 and 1560.",
    "Fajardo attempted to establish a plantation in the valley in 1562 after these unsuccessful coastal towns, but it did not last long: it was destroyed by natives of the region led by Terepaima and Guaicaipuro. Fajardo's 1560 settlement was known as Hato de San Francisco, and another attempt in 1561 by Juan Rodríguez de Suárez was called Villa de San Francisco, and was also destroyed by the same native people. The eventual settlers of Caracas came from Coro, the German capital of their Klein-Venedig colony around the present-day coastal Colombia–Venezuela border; from the 1540s, the colony had been de facto controlled by Spaniards.",
    "Moving eastward from Coro, groups of Spanish settlers founded inland towns including Barquisimeto and Valencia before reaching the Caracas valley..",
    "On 25 July 1567, Captain Diego de Losada laid the foundations of the city of Santiago de León de Caracas. De Losada had been commissioned to capture the valley, and was successful by splitting the natives into different groups to work with, then fighting and defeating each of them. The town was the closest to the coast of these new settlements, and the colonists retained a native workforce, which allowed a trade network to develop between Caracas, the interior, and Margarita; the towns further inland produced ample cotton products and beeswax, and Margarita was a rich source of pearls.",
    "The Caracas valley had a good environment for both agricultural and arable farming, which contributed to the system of commerce but meant that the town's population was initially sparse, as it was only large enough to support a few farms..",
    "In 1577, Caracas became the capital of the Spanish Empire's Venezuela Province under the province's new governor, Juan de Pimentel . In the 1580s, Caraqueños started selling food to the Spanish soldiers in Cartagena, who often docked in the coastal city when collecting products from the empire in South America.",

    "Encountering little resistance, the invaders sacked and set fire to the town after a failed ransom negotiation. The city managed to rebuild, using wheat profits and \"a lot of sacrifice\". In the 1620s, farmers in Caracas discovered that Cacao beans could be sold, first selling them to native people of Mexico and quickly growing across the Caribbean.",

Caracas then came under worse luck: in 1812, an earthquake destroyed Caracas, a quarter of its population migrated in 1814, and the Venezuelan War of Independence continued until 24 June 1821, when Simón Bolívar defeated royalists in the Battle of Carabobo. Urban reforms only took place towards the end of the 19th century, under Antonio Guzmán Blanco: some landmarks were built, but the city remained distinctly colonial until the 1930s..",

The total surface is 94,250 square miles , and the total volume  is 5,439 cubic miles , slightly less than the volume of Lake Baikal .",
    "Because of their sea-like characteristics, such as rolling waves, sustained winds, strong currents, great depths, and distant horizons, the five Great Lakes have long been called inland seas. Depending on how it is measured, by surface area, either Lake Superior or Lake Michigan-Huron is the second-largest lake in the world and the largest freshwater lake.",
    "The Great Lakes began to form at the end of the Last Glacial Period around 14,000 years ago, as retreating ice sheets exposed the basins they had carved into the land, which then filled with meltwater. The lakes have been a major source for transportation, migration, trade, and fishing, serving as a habitat to many aquatic species in a region with much biodiversity.",

Lake Michigan is the only one of the Great Lakes that is entirely within the United States; the others form a water boundary between the United States and Canada.",

    "Dispersed throughout the Great Lakes are approximately 35,000 islands. The largest among them is Manitoulin Island in Lake Huron, the largest island in any inland body of water in the world. The second-largest island is Isle Royale in Lake Superior. Both of these islands are large enough to contain multiple lakes themselves—for instance, Manitoulin Island's Lake Manitou is the world's largest lake on a freshwater island. Some of these lakes even have their own islands, like Treasure Island in Lake Mindemoya in Manitoulin Island.",
    "The Great Lakes also have several peninsulas between them, including the Door Peninsula, the Peninsulas of Michigan, and the Ontario Peninsula.",

    "The names Land of Israel and Children of Israel have historically been used to refer to the biblical Kingdom of Israel and the entire Jewish people respectively. The name 'Israel'  in these phrases refers to the patriarch Jacob who, according to the Hebrew Bible, was given the name after he successfully wrestled with the angel of the Lord. Jacob's twelve sons became the ancestors of the Israelites, also known as the Twelve Tribes of Israel or Children of Israel.",
    "Jacob and his sons had lived in Canaan but were forced by famine to go into Egypt for four generations, lasting 430 years, until Moses, a great-great-grandson of Jacob, led the Israelites back into Canaan during the \"Exodus\".",
    "The earliest known archaeological artefact to mention the word \"Israel\" as a collective is the Merneptah Stele of ancient Egypt ..",
    "The oldest evidence of early humans in the territory of modern Israel, dating to 1.5 million years ago, was found in Ubeidiya near the Sea of Galilee. Other notable Paleolithic sites include the caves Tabun, Qesem and Manot.",
    "The oldest fossils of anatomically modern humans found outside Africa are the Skhul and Qafzeh hominins, who lived in the area that is now northern Israel 120,000 years ago. Around the 10th millennium BCE, the Natufian culture existed in the area..",
    "A people named Israel appear for the first time in the Merneptah Stele, an ancient Egyptian inscription which dates to about 1200 BCE. Ancestors of the Israelites are thought to have included ancient Semitic-speaking peoples native to this area.: 78–79  According to the modern archaeological account, the Israelites and their culture branched out of the Canaanite peoples and their cultures through the development of a distinct monolatristic—and later monotheistic—religion centered on Yahweh. They spoke an archaic form of the Hebrew language, known as Biblical Hebrew. Around the same time, the Philistines settled on the southern coastal plain..",
    "Modern archaeology has largely discarded the historicity of the narrative in the Torah concerning the patriarchs, The Exodus, and the conquest of Canaan described in the Book of Joshua, and instead views the narrative as constituting the Israelites' national myth. However, some elements of these traditions do appear to have historical roots..",
    "There is debate about the earliest existence of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah and their extent and power.",
    "While it is unclear if there was ever a United Kingdom of Israel, historians and archaeologists agree that the northern Kingdom of Israel existed by ca.",
    "850 BCE. The Kingdom of Israel was the more prosperous of the two kingdoms and soon developed into a regional power; during the days of the Omride dynasty, it controlled Samaria, Galilee, the upper Jordan Valley, the Sharon and large parts of the Transjordan. Samaria, the capital, was home to one of the largest Iron Age structures in the Levant. The kingdom was destroyed around 720 BCE, when it was conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire. The Kingdom of Judah, with its capital in Jerusalem, later became a client state of first the Neo-Assyrian Empire and then the Neo-Babylonian Empire.",
    "Since the existence of the earliest Jewish diaspora, many Jews have aspired to return to \"Zion\" and the \"Land of Israel\", though the amount of effort that should be spent towards such an aim was a matter of dispute. During the 16th century, Jewish communities struck roots in the Four Holy Cities—Jerusalem, Tiberias, Hebron, and Safed—and in 1697, Rabbi Yehuda Hachasid led a group of 1,500 Jews to Jerusalem. In the second half of the 18th century, Eastern European opponents of Hasidism, known as the Perushim, settled in Palestine..",
    "The first wave of modern Jewish migration to Ottoman-ruled Palestine, known as the First Aliyah, began in 1881, as Jews fled pogroms in Eastern Europe. Although the Zionist movement already existed in practice, Austro-Hungarian journalist Theodor Herzl is credited with founding political Zionism, a movement that sought to establish a Jewish state in the Land of Israel, thus offering a solution to the so-called Jewish question of the European states, in conformity with the goals and achievements of other national projects of the time. In 1896, Herzl published Der Judenstaat , offering his vision of a future Jewish state; the following year he presided over the First Zionist Congress in Basel, Switzerland. The Second Aliyah  began after the Kishinev pogrom; some 40,000 Jews settled in Palestine, although nearly half of them left eventually.",
    "In 1918, the Jewish Legion, a group primarily of Zionist volunteers, assisted in the British conquest of Palestine. In 1920, after the Allies conquered the Levant during World War I, the territory was divided between Britain and France under the mandate system, and the British-administered area which included modern day Israel was named Mandatory Palestine. Arab opposition to British rule and Jewish immigration led to the 1920 Palestine riots and the formation of a Jewish militia known as the Haganah  in 1920 as an outgrowth of Hashomer, from which the Irgun and Lehi  paramilitaries later split off. In 1922, the League of Nations granted Britain the Mandate for Palestine under terms which included the Balfour Declaration with its promise to the Jews, and with similar provisions regarding the Arab Palestinians. The population of the area at this time was predominantly Arab and Muslim, with Jews accounting for about 11%, and Arab Christians about 9.5% of the population..",
    "On 14 May 1948, the day before the expiration of the British Mandate, David Ben-Gurion, the head of the Jewish Agency, declared \"the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz-Israel, to be known as the State of Israel.\" The only reference in the text of the Declaration to the borders of the new state is the use of the term Eretz-Israel . The following day, the armies of four Arab countries—Egypt, Syria, Transjordan and Iraq—entered into parts of what had been British Mandatory Palestine, launching the 1948 Arab–Israeli War; contingents from Yemen, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Sudan joined the war. The apparent purpose of the invasion was to prevent the establishment of the Jewish state at inception, and some Arab leaders talked about \"driving the Jews into the sea\". According to Benny Morris, Jews were worried that the invading Arab armies held the intent to slaughter them. The Arab league stated the invasion was to restore law and order and to prevent further bloodshed..",
    "The UN estimated that more than 700,000 Palestinians were expelled by or fled from advancing Israeli forces during the conflict—what would become known in Arabic as the Nakba . Some 156,000 remained and became Arab citizens of Israel..",
    "Israel was admitted as a member of the UN by majority vote on 11 May 1949. An Israeli-Jordanian attempt at negotiating a peace agreement broke down after the British government, fearful of the Egyptian reaction to such a treaty, expressed their opposition to the Jordanian government. In the early years of the state, the Labor Zionist movement led by Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion dominated Israeli politics..",
    "Immigration to Israel during the late 1940s and early 1950s was aided by the Israeli Immigration Department and the non-government sponsored Mossad LeAliyah Bet (lit.",
    "The immigrants came for differing reasons: some held Zionist beliefs or came for the promise of a better life in Israel, while others moved to escape persecution or were expelled.."

The English language, the Anglican Church, and English law—the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world—developed in England, and the country's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations. The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England, transforming its society into the world's first industrialised nation..",
    "England's terrain is chiefly low hills and plains, especially in central and southern England.",
    "England's population of 56.3 million comprises 84% of the population of the United Kingdom, largely concentrated around London, the South East, and conurbations in the Midlands, the North West, the North East, and Yorkshire, which each developed as major industrial regions during the 19th century..",
    "The Kingdom of England – which after 1535 included Wales – ceased being a separate sovereign state on 1 May 1707, when the Acts of Union put into effect the terms agreed in the Treaty of Union the previous year, resulting in a political union with the Kingdom of Scotland to create the Kingdom of Great Britain. In 1801, Great Britain was united with the Kingdom of Ireland  to become the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.",
    "The name \"England\" is derived from the Old English name Englaland, which means \"land of the Angles\". The Angles were one of the Germanic tribes that settled in Great Britain during the Early Middle Ages.",
    "The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recorded that the Domesday Book of 1086 covered the whole of England, meaning the English kingdom, but a few years later the Chronicle stated that King Malcolm III went \"out of Scotlande into Lothian in Englaland\", thus using it in the more ancient sense..",
    "The earliest attested reference to the Angles occurs in the 1st-century work by Tacitus, Germania, in which the Latin word Anglii is used. The etymology of the tribal name itself is disputed by scholars; it has been suggested that it derives from the shape of the Angeln peninsula, an angular shape. How and why a term derived from the name of a tribe that was less significant than others, such as the Saxons, came to be used for the entire country and its people is not known, but it seems this is related to the custom of calling the Germanic people in Britain Angli Saxones or English Saxons to distinguish them from continental Saxons  of Old Saxony between the Weser and Eider rivers in Northern Germany. In Scottish Gaelic, another language which developed on the island of Great Britain, the Saxon tribe gave their name to the word for England ; similarly, the Welsh name for the English language is \"Saesneg\".",
    "A romantic name for England is Loegria, related to the Welsh word for England, Lloegr, and made popular by its use in Arthurian legend.",

    "The oldest proto-human bones discovered in England date from 500,000 years ago. Modern humans are known to have inhabited the area during the Upper Paleolithic period, though permanent settlements were only established within the last 6,000 years. After the last ice age only large mammals such as mammoths, bison and woolly rhinoceros remained.",

    "This brought about the political unification of England, first accomplished under Æthelstan in 927 and definitively established after further conflicts by Eadred in 953.",
    "Subsequently, the House of Plantagenet from Anjou inherited the English throne under Henry II, adding England to the budding Angevin Empire of fiefs the family had inherited in France including Aquitaine. They reigned for three centuries, some noted monarchs being Richard I, Edward I, Edward III and Henry V. The period saw changes in trade and legislation, including the signing of the Magna Carta, an English legal charter used to limit the sovereign's powers by law and protect the privileges of freemen.",
    "During the 14th century, the Plantagenets and the House of Valois both claimed to be legitimate claimants to the House of Capet and with it France; the two powers clashed in the Hundred Years' War. The Black Death epidemic hit England; starting in 1348, it eventually killed up to half of England's inhabitants. From 1453 to 1487 civil war occurred between two branches of the royal family – the Yorkists and Lancastrians – known as the Wars of the Roses. Eventually it led to the Yorkists losing the throne entirely to a Welsh noble family the Tudors, a branch of the Lancastrians headed by Henry Tudor who invaded with Welsh and Breton mercenaries, gaining victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field where the Yorkist king Richard III was killed..",
    "During the Tudor period, the Renaissance reached England through Italian courtiers, who reintroduced artistic, educational and scholarly debate from classical antiquity. England began to develop naval skills, and exploration to the West intensified. Henry VIII broke from communion with the Catholic Church, over issues relating to his divorce, under the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch head of the Church of England.",
    "In contrast with much of European Protestantism, the roots of the split were more political than theological. He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the 1535–1542 acts.",
    "Elizabethan England represented the apogee of the English Renaissance and saw the flowering of art, poetry, music and literature. The era is most famous for its drama, theatre and playwrights.",
    "England during this period had a centralised, well-organised, and effective government as a result of vast Tudor reforms..",
    "The Roanoke colony failed and is known as the lost colony after it was found abandoned on the return of the late-arriving supply ship. With the East India Company, England also competed with the Dutch and French in the East.",
    "During the Elizabethan period, England was at war with Spain.",
    "An armada sailed from Spain in 1588 as part of a wider plan to invade England and re-establish a Catholic monarchy.",
    "The political structure of the island changed in 1603, when the King of Scots, James VI, a kingdom which had been a long-time rival to English interests, inherited the throne of England as James I, thereby creating a personal union. He styled himself King of Great Britain, although this had no basis in English law. Under the auspices of James VI and I the Authorised King James Version of the Holy Bible was published in 1611.",
    "Though the Tories initially supported Catholic king James II, some of them, along with the Whigs, during the Revolution of 1688 invited Dutch Prince William of Orange to defeat James and ultimately to become William III of England.",
    "Under the Stuart dynasty England expanded in trade, finance and prosperity.",
    "Britain developed Europe's largest merchant fleet. After the parliaments of England and Scotland agreed, the two countries joined in political union, to create the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. To accommodate the union, institutions such as the law and national churches of each remained separate..",
    "Domestically it drove the Industrial Revolution, a period of profound change in the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of England, resulting in industrialised agriculture, manufacture, engineering and mining, as well as new and pioneering road, rail and water networks to facilitate their expansion and development. The opening of Northwest England's Bridgewater Canal in 1761 ushered in the canal age in Britain. In 1825 the world's first permanent steam locomotive-hauled passenger railway – the Stockton and Darlington Railway – opened to the public..",
    "During the Industrial Revolution, many workers moved from England's countryside to new and expanding urban industrial areas to work in factories, for instance at Birmingham and Manchester, dubbed \"Workshop of the World\" and \"Warehouse City\" respectively. Manchester was the world's first industrial city. England maintained relative stability throughout the French Revolution; William Pitt the Younger was British prime minister for the reign of George III."

    "A banana is an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa. In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called \"plantains\", distinguishing them from dessert bananas.",
    "Almost all modern edible seedless  bananas come from two wild species – Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana.",
    "The scientific names of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa × paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata × M.",
    "The world's largest producers of bananas in 2017 were India and China, which together accounted for approximately 38% of total production..",
    "Worldwide, there is no sharp distinction between \"bananas\" and \"plantains\".",
    "Especially in the Americas and Europe, \"banana\" usually refers to soft, sweet, dessert bananas, particularly those of the Cavendish group, which are the main exports from banana-growing countries.",
    "In the US, as of 2019, these bananas, by poundage, are the most consumed fresh fruit. By contrast, Musa cultivars with firmer, starchier fruit are called \"plantains\".",
    "The term \"banana\" is also used as the common name for the plants that produce the fruit. This can extend to other members of the genus Musa, such as the scarlet banana , the pink banana , and the Fe'i bananas.",
    "Bananas grow in a wide variety of soils, as long as the soil is at least 60 centimetres  deep, has good drainage and is not compacted. Banana plants are among the fastest growing of all plants, with daily surface growth rates recorded of 1.4 square metres  to 1.6 square metres ..",
    "As with all living things on earth, potassium-containing bananas emit radioactivity at low levels occurring naturally from potassium-40 , which is one of several isotopes of potassium. The banana equivalent dose of radiation was developed in 1995 as a simple teaching-tool to educate the public about the natural, small amount of K-40 radiation occurring in every human and in common foods..",
    "The classification of cultivated bananas has long been a problematic issue for taxonomists.",
    "Linnaeus originally placed bananas into two species based only on their uses as food: Musa sapientum for dessert bananas and Musa paradisiaca for plantains.",
    "In a series of papers published from 1947 onwards, Ernest Cheesman showed that Linnaeus's Musa sapientum and Musa paradisiaca were cultivars and descendants of two wild seed-producing species, Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana, both first described by Luigi Aloysius Colla. Cheesman recommended the abolition of Linnaeus's species in favor of reclassifying bananas according to three morphologically distinct groups of cultivars – those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of Musa balbisiana, those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of Musa acuminata, and those with characteristics of both. Researchers Norman Simmonds and Ken Shepherd proposed a genome-based nomenclature system in 1955.",
    "This system eliminated almost all the difficulties and inconsistencies of the earlier classification of bananas based on assigning scientific names to cultivated varieties.",
    "The accepted scientific names for most groups of cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata Colla and Musa balbisiana Colla for the ancestral species, and Musa × paradisiaca L.",
    "In regions such as North America and Europe, Musa fruits offered for sale can be divided into \"bananas\" and \"plantains\" , based on their intended use as food.",
    "The stated differences are that plantains are more starchy and less sweet; they are eaten cooked rather than raw; they have thicker skin, which may be green, yellow or black; and they can be used at any stage of ripeness. Linnaeus made the same distinction between plantains and bananas when first naming two \"species\" of Musa. Members of the \"plantain subgroup\" of banana cultivars, most important as food in West Africa and Latin America, correspond to the Chiquita description, having long pointed fruit.",
    "as \"true\" plantains, distinct from other cooking bananas. The cooking bananas of East Africa belong to a different group, the East African Highland bananas, so would not qualify as \"true\" plantains on this definition.",
    "An alternative approach divides bananas into dessert bananas and cooking bananas, with plantains being one of the subgroups of cooking bananas. Triploid cultivars derived solely from M.",
    "acuminata are examples of \"dessert bananas\", whereas triploid cultivars derived from the hybrid between M.",
    "A study of these cultivars showed that they could be placed into at least three groups based on their characteristics: dessert bananas, non-plantain cooking bananas, and plantains, although there were overlaps between dessert and cooking bananas..",
    "In Southeast Asia—the center of diversity for bananas, both wild and cultivated—the distinction between \"bananas\" and \"plantains\" does not work, according to Valmayor et al.",
    "Many bananas are used both raw and cooked.",
    "There are starchy cooking bananas which are smaller than those eaten raw.",
    "The range of colors, sizes and shapes is far wider than in those grown or sold in Africa, Europe or the Americas. Southeast Asian languages do not make the distinction between \"bananas\" and \"plantains\" that is made in English .",
    "Thus both Cavendish cultivars, the classic yellow dessert bananas, and Saba cultivars, used mainly for cooking, are called pisang in Malaysia and Indonesia, kluai in Thailand and chuối in Vietnam. Fe'i bananas, grown and eaten in the islands of the Pacific, are derived from entirely different wild species than traditional bananas and plantains.",
    "Most Fe'i bananas are cooked, but Karat bananas, which are short and squat with bright red skins, very different from the usual yellow dessert bananas, are eaten raw..",
    "In summary, in commerce in Europe and the Americas , it is possible to distinguish between \"bananas\", which are eaten raw, and \"plantains\", which are cooked.",
    "Plantains are one of many kinds of cooking bananas, which are not always distinct from dessert bananas.",

Italy's commercial and political power significantly waned during the 17th and 18th centuries with the decline of the Catholic Church and the increasing importance of trade routes that bypassed the Mediterranean..",
    "By the mid-19th century, rising Italian nationalism, along with other social, economic, and military events, led to a period of revolutionary political upheaval. After centuries of political and territorial divisions, Italy was almost entirely unified in 1861 following a war of independence, establishing the Kingdom of Italy. From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, Italy rapidly industrialised, mainly in the north, and acquired a colonial empire, while the south remained largely impoverished and excluded from industrialisation, fuelling a large and influential diaspora. Despite being one of the victorious allied powers in World War I, Italy entered a period of economic crisis and social turmoil, leading to the rise of the Italian fascist dictatorship in 1922.",

    "The republics were heavily involved in the Crusades, providing support and transport, but most especially taking advantage of the political and trading opportunities resulting from these wars. Italy first felt the huge economic changes in Europe which led to the commercial revolution: the Republic of Venice was able to defeat the Byzantine Empire and finance the voyages of Marco Polo to Asia; the first universities were formed in Italian cities, and scholars such as Thomas Aquinas obtained international fame; Frederick I of Sicily made Italy the political-cultural centre of a reign that temporarily included the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Jerusalem; capitalism and banking families emerged in Florence, where Dante and Giotto were active around 1300..",

The Renaissance was therefore a result of the wealth accumulated by Italian merchant cities combined with the patronage of its dominant families. Italian Renaissance exercised a dominant influence on subsequent European painting and sculpture for centuries afterwards, with artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Brunelleschi, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Raphael, Giotto, Donatello, and Titian, and architects such as Filippo Brunelleschi, Leon Battista Alberti, Andrea Palladio, and Donato Bramante.",

At the same time, FX had also started development of Dirt, a female-centric crime-based drama series, and with three existing male-centric shows already on the network, FX passed up Breaking Bad for Dirt..",
    "Once Gilligan recognized that this would mean \"we'd always have to be avoiding the Sandia Mountains\" in shots directed toward the east, the story setting was changed to the actual production location. It was shot primarily on 35 mm film, with digital cameras employed as needed for additional angles, point of view shots and time-lapse photography. Breaking Bad cost $3 million per episode to produce, higher than the average cost for a basic cable program..",

At the same time, Netflix was starting to aggressively shop for content to add to its service and arranged a deal with Sony for Breaking Bad to be available after the airing of the fourth season.",

In early August 2011, negotiations began over a deal regarding the fifth and possible final season between the network AMC and Sony Pictures Television, the production company of the series.",
    "Before the series finale, Gilligan said that it was difficult to write for Walter White because the character was so dark and morally questionable: \"I'm going to miss the show when it's over, but on some level, it'll be a relief to not have Walt in my head anymore.\" Gilligan later said the idea for Walter's character intrigued him so much that he \"didn't really give much thought on how well it would sell\", stating that he would have given up on the premise since it was \"such an odd, dark story\" that could have difficulties being pitched to studios. Ultimately, Gilligan chose to end Breaking Bad with Walter's death, occurring in-story two years after he had first been diagnosed with cancer and given two years to live.",

    "The main gameplay of Darkest Dungeon started out as a tile-based game that had the player control a group of characters as they moved about in a dungeon, eventually transitioning into a combat mode when they had encounters.",
    "They worked around this by using the same side-view not only for combat but for dungeon exploration, creating the basic gameplay of Darkest Dungeon..",
    "The Affliction system was inspired by psychologically traumatized heroes, both through historical events as well as works of fiction such as Hudson from Aliens and the soldiers from Band of Brothers who are transformed by the horrors of combat; Sigman pointed to the seventh episode of Band of Brothers where a soldier watches his friends die from a shell explosion, stares transfixed at the event, and then becomes unable to fight any more, as the feeling they wanted to capture. Though they were also inspired by Lovecraftian horror, they did not want to use the concept of \"insanity\" that is common in that genre, and instead focused more on the nature of stress and how it affected the human psyche. Because of the importance of the Affliction system to Darkest Dungeon, the developers spent significant time to make sure that the impact of stress and afflictions were emphasized dramatically in the game's presentation, using special graphics and sound cues to signal the onset of an affliction. They also created a \"bark system\", dialog stated by a character reflecting their current stress, affliction, and other attributes as another means to humanize the characters and remind the player that they do not have full control of the characters. Alongside the Affliction system, they developed the town facilities that are used to cure afflictions and reduce stress, using concepts they borrowed from tabletop games. They also included Virtues, positive afflictions that can result from high stress situations, and a means of tracking the afflictions of a given character over time, so that in future stress situations the character will often become encumbered by the same affliction, developing a behavioral pattern that the player may be able to use to their benefit..",

They used feedback from the Early Access period, particularly through those that streamed their playthrough of the game, to help with playtesting and adjust the balance of the game, while also finding that their approach to gameplay and presentation was validated by positive reception from these streamers. Sigman noted that developing in Early Access was comparable to \"working while naked in a transparent cube suspended above Times Square\", but felt their transparency with players made the final product much better. Bourassa and Sigman noted that they had had some issues with user feedback during Early Access, specifically after they added two gameplay elements around July 2015: the addition of corpses which affected combat positioning issues, and the possibility of a stressed character suffering a heart attack and dying immediately.",

    "In places where UberEats is offered, Uber will collaborate with multiple restaurants every day to serve meals to its passengers. The company is facing a lawsuit for antitrust price manipulation, from forcing restaurants to charge the same price for delivery as for dine-in if the restaurant wants to be listed on UberEats' app, along with charging fees of 13–40% of revenue.",

    "Toward the end of the 1st millennium, Goguryeo was resurrected as Goryeo, which defeated the two other states and unified the Korean Peninsula as a single sovereign state.",
    "Goryeo , whose name developed into the modern exonym \"Korea\", was a highly cultured state that created the world's first metal movable type in 1234. However, multiple incursions by the Mongol Empire during the 13th century greatly weakened the nation, which eventually agreed to become a vassal state after decades of fighting.",
    "During this period, the Korean alphabet was created by Sejong the Great in the 15th century and there was increasing influence of Confucianism.",
    "During the later part of the dynasty, Korea's isolationist policy earned it the Western nickname of the \"hermit kingdom\".",

    "The Soviet Union and the United States had agreed to partition Korea along the 38th parallel, with the Soviets occupying the north and the Americans occupying the south.",
    "These circumstances became the basis for the division of Korea by the two superpowers with two different ideologies, exacerbated by their inability to agree on the terms of Korean independence.",
    "The Communist-inspired government in the North received backing from the Soviet Union in opposition to the pro-Western government in the South, leading to Korea's division into two sovereign states in 1948: North Korea, and South Korea.",

Goryeo's name was a continuation of Goguryeo  the northernmost of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, which was officially known as Goryeo beginning in the 5th century. The original name was a combination of the adjective go  with the name of a local Yemaek tribe, whose original name is thought to have been either *Guru  or Gauri .",
    "With expanding British and American trade following the opening of Korea in the late 19th century, the spelling \"Korea\" appeared and gradually grew in popularity; its use in transcribing East Asian languages avoids the issues caused by the separate hard and soft Cs existing in English vocabulary derived from the Romance languages.",

    "Weak may refer to:.",
    "In nuclear physics and particle physics, the weak interaction, which is also often called the weak force or weak nuclear force, is one of the four known fundamental interactions, with the others being electromagnetism, the strong interaction, and gravitation.",
    "It is the mechanism of interaction between subatomic particles that is responsible for the radioactive decay of atoms: The weak interaction participates in nuclear fission and nuclear fusion.",
    "The theory describing its behaviour and effects is sometimes called quantum flavourdynamics ; however, the term QFD is rarely used, because the weak force is better understood by electroweak theory ..",
    "The effective range of the weak force is limited to subatomic distances and is less than the diameter of a proton..",
    "The Standard Model of particle physics provides a uniform framework for understanding electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions.",
    "protons or neutrons), although at the deepest levels, all weak interactions ultimately are between elementary particles.",
    "In the weak interaction, fermions can exchange three types of force carriers, namely W+, W−, and Z bosons.",
    "The masses of these bosons are far greater than the mass of a proton or neutron, which is consistent with the short range of the weak force.",
    "In fact, the force is termed weak because its field strength over any set distance is typically several orders of magnitude less than that of the electromagnetic force, which itself is further orders of magnitude less than the strong nuclear force.",
    "The weak interaction is the only fundamental interaction that breaks parity symmetry, and similarly, but far more rarely, the only interaction to break charge–parity symmetry.",
    "The weak interaction is unique in that it allows quarks to swap their flavour for another.",
    "Another important example of a phenomenon involving the weak interaction is the fusion of hydrogen into helium, which powers the Sun's thermonuclear process.",
    "Most fermions decay by a weak interaction over time.",
    "Such decay makes radiocarbon dating possible, as carbon-14 decays through the weak interaction to nitrogen-14.",
    "The electroweak force separated into the electromagnetic and weak forces during the quark epoch of the early universe.",
    "In 1933, Enrico Fermi proposed the first theory of the weak interaction, known as Fermi's interaction.",
    "However, it is better described as a non-contact force field having a finite range, albeit very short. In the 1960s, Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg unified the electromagnetic force and the weak interaction by showing them to be two aspects of a single force, now termed the electroweak force..",
    "The electrically charged weak interaction is unique in a number of respects:.",
    "Due to their large mass  these carrier particles, called the W and Z bosons, are short-lived with a lifetime of under 10−24 seconds. The weak interaction has a coupling constant  between 10−7 and 10−6, compared to the electromagnetic coupling constant of about 10−2 and the strong interaction coupling constant of 1; consequently the weak interaction is \"weak\" in terms of intensity. The weak interaction has a very short effective range . At distances around 10−18 meters , the weak interaction has an intensity of a similar magnitude to the electromagnetic force, but this starts to decrease exponentially with increasing distance.",
    "Scaled up by just one and a half orders of magnitude, at distances of around 3×10−17 m, the weak interaction becomes 10,000 times weaker..",
    "The weak interaction affects all the fermions of the Standard Model, as well as the Higgs boson; neutrinos interact only through gravity and the weak interaction.",
    "The weak interaction does not produce bound states, nor does it involve binding energy – something that gravity does on an astronomical scale, the electromagnetic force does at the molecular and atomic levels, and the strong nuclear force does only at the subatomic level, inside of nuclei..",
    "Its most noticeable effect is due to its first unique feature: The charged weak interaction causes flavour change.",
    "Neither the strong interaction nor electromagnetism permit flavour changing, so this can only proceed by weak decay; without weak decay, quark properties such as strangeness and charm  would also be conserved across all interactions.",
    "All mesons are unstable because of weak decay. In the process known as beta decay, a down quark in the neutron can change into an up quark by emitting a virtual\nW−\n boson, which then decays into an electron and an electron antineutrino. Another example is electron capture – a common variant of radioactive decay – wherein a proton and an electron within an atom interact and are changed to a neutron , and an electron neutrino is emitted.",
    "Due to the large masses of the W bosons, particle transformations or decays  that depend on the weak interaction typically occur much more slowly than transformations or decays that depend only on the strong or electromagnetic forces. For example, a neutral pion decays electromagnetically, and so has a life of only about 10−16 seconds.",
    "In contrast, a charged pion can only decay through the weak interaction, and so lives about 10−8 seconds, or a hundred million times longer than a neutral pion. A particularly extreme example is the weak-force decay of a free neutron, which takes about 15 minutes..",
    "All particles have a property called weak isospin , which serves as an additive quantum number that restricts how the particle can interact with the\nW±\nof the weak force.",
    "Weak isospin plays the same role in the weak interaction with\nW±\nas electric charge does in electromagnetism, and color charge in the strong interaction; a different number with a similar name, weak charge, discussed below, is used for interactions with the\nZ0\n."

  "hard": [
    "Hard may refer to:.",
    "Hard rock or heavy rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music typified by aggressive vocals and distorted electric guitars.",
    "Hard rock began in the mid-1960s with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements.",
    "Some of the earliest hard rock music was produced by the Kinks, the Who, the Rolling Stones, Cream, Vanilla Fudge, and the Jimi Hendrix Experience.",
    "In the late 1960s, bands such as Blue Cheer, the Jeff Beck Group, Iron Butterfly, Led Zeppelin, Golden Earring, Steppenwolf and Deep Purple also produced hard rock.",
    "During the 1980s, some hard rock bands moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock. Established bands made a comeback in the mid-1980s and hard rock reached a commercial peak in the 1980s, with glam metal bands such as Bon Jovi and Def Leppard and the rawer sounds of Guns N' Roses which followed with great success in the later part of that decade.",
    "Hard rock began losing popularity with the commercial success of R&B, hip-hop, urban pop, grunge and later Britpop in the 1990s.",
    "Despite this, many post-grunge bands adopted a hard rock sound and the 2000s saw a renewed interest in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands that emerged from the garage rock and post-punk revival scenes.",
    "In the 2000s, only a few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.",
    "Hard rock is a form of loud, aggressive rock music.",
    "In the late 1960s, the term heavy metal was used interchangeably with hard rock, but gradually began to be used to describe music played with even more volume and intensity. While hard rock maintained a bluesy rock and roll identity, including some swing in the back beat and riffs that tended to outline chord progressions in their hooks, heavy metal's riffs often functioned as stand-alone melodies and had no swing in them. In the 1980s heavy metal developed a number of subgenres, often termed extreme metal, some of which were influenced by hardcore punk, and which further differentiated the two styles. Despite this differentiation, hard rock and heavy metal have existed side by side, with bands frequently standing on the boundary of, or crossing between, the genres..",
    "The roots of hard rock can be traced back to the mid to late 1950s, particularly electric blues, which laid the foundations for key elements such as a rough declamatory vocal style, heavy guitar riffs, string-bending blues-scale guitar solos, strong beat, thick riff-laden texture, and posturing performances. Electric blues guitarists began experimenting with hard rock elements such as driving rhythms, distorted guitar solos and power chords in the 1950s, evident in the work of Memphis blues guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson, and particularly Pat Hare, who captured a \"grittier, nastier, more ferocious electric guitar sound\" on records such as James Cotton's \"Cotton Crop Blues\" . Other antecedents include Link Wray's instrumental \"Rumble\" in 1958, and the surf rock instrumentals of Dick Dale, such as \"Let's Go Trippin'\"  and \"Misirlou\" .",
    "In the 1960s, American and British blues and rock bands began to modify rock and roll by adding harder sounds, heavier guitar riffs, bombastic drumming, and louder vocals, from electric blues. Early forms of hard rock can be heard in the work of Chicago blues musicians Elmore James, Muddy Waters, and Howlin' Wolf, the Kingsmen's version of \"Louie Louie\"  which made it a garage rock standard, and the songs of rhythm and blues influenced British Invasion acts, including \"You Really Got Me\" by the Kinks , \"My Generation\" by the Who  and \" Satisfaction\"  by the Rolling Stones. From the late 1960s, it became common to divide mainstream rock music that emerged from psychedelia into soft and hard rock. Soft rock was often derived from folk rock, using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies. In contrast, hard rock was most often derived from blues rock and was played louder and with more intensity..",
    "Blues rock acts that pioneered the sound included Cream, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and the Jeff Beck Group. Cream, in songs like \"I Feel Free\"  combined blues rock with pop and psychedelia, particularly in the riffs and guitar solos of Eric Clapton. Cream's best known-song, \"Sunshine of Your Love\" , is sometimes considered to be the culmination of the British adaptation of blues into rock and a direct precursor of Led Zeppelin's style of hard rock and heavy metal. Jimi Hendrix produced a form of blues-influenced psychedelic rock, which combined elements of jazz, blues and rock and roll. From 1967 Jeff Beck brought lead guitar to new heights of technical virtuosity and moved blues rock in the direction of heavy rock with his band, the Jeff Beck Group. Dave Davies of the Kinks, Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, Pete Townshend of the Who, Hendrix, Clapton and Beck all pioneered the use of new guitar effects like phasing, feedback and distortion. The Doors' debut album released in 1967, included songs like \"Soul Kitchen\", \"Twentieth Century Fox\", and a cover version of \"Back Door Man\", which were what music journalist Stephen Davis characterized as \"enough hard rock tracks\". The Beatles began producing songs in the new hard rock style beginning with their 1968 double album The Beatles  and, with the track \"Helter Skelter\", attempted to create a greater level of noise than the Who. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic has referred to the \"proto-metal roar\" of \"Helter Skelter\", while Ian MacDonald called it \"ridiculous, with McCartney shrieking weedily against a massively tape-echoed backdrop of out-of-tune thrashing\"..",
    "Groups that emerged from the American psychedelic scene about the same time included Iron Butterfly, MC5, Blue Cheer and Vanilla Fudge. San Francisco band Blue Cheer released a crude and distorted cover of Eddie Cochran's classic \"Summertime Blues\", from their 1968 debut album Vincebus Eruptum, that outlined much of the later hard rock and heavy metal sound. The same month, Steppenwolf released its self-titled debut album, including \"Born to Be Wild\", which contained the first lyrical reference to heavy metal and helped popularise the style when it was used in the film Easy Rider . Iron Butterfly's In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida , with its 17-minute-long title track, using organs and with a lengthy drum solo, also prefigured later elements of the sound..",
    "By the end of the decade a distinct genre of hard rock was emerging with bands like Led Zeppelin, who mixed the music of early rock bands with a more hard-edged form of blues rock and acid rock on their first two albums Led Zeppelin  and Led Zeppelin II , and Deep Purple, who began as a progressive rock group in 1968 but achieved their commercial breakthrough with their fourth and distinctively heavier album, Deep Purple in Rock .",
    "Also significant was Black Sabbath's Paranoid , which combined guitar riffs with dissonance and more explicit references to the occult and elements of Gothic horror. All three of these bands have been seen as pivotal in the development of heavy metal, but where metal further accentuated the intensity of the music, with bands like Judas Priest following Sabbath's lead into territory that was often \"darker and more menacing\", hard rock tended to continue to remain the more exuberant, good-time music..",
    "In the early 1970s the Rolling Stones further developed their hard rock sound with Exile on Main St. .",
    "Initially receiving mixed reviews, according to critic Steve Erlewine it is now \"generally regarded as the Rolling Stones' finest album\". They continued to pursue the riff-heavy sound on albums including It's Only Rock 'n' Roll  and Black and Blue . Led Zeppelin began to mix elements of world and folk music into their hard rock from Led Zeppelin III  and Led Zeppelin IV .",
    "The latter included the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", which would become the most played song in the history of album-oriented radio. Deep Purple continued to define their unique brand of hard rock, particularly with their album Machine Head , which included the tracks \"Highway Star\" and \"Smoke on the Water\". In 1975 guitarist Ritchie Blackmore left, going on to form Rainbow and after the break-up of the band the next year, vocalist David Coverdale formed Whitesnake. 1970 saw the Who release Live at Leeds, often seen as the archetypal hard rock live album, and the following year they released their highly acclaimed album Who's Next, which mixed heavy rock with extensive use of synthesizers. Subsequent albums, including Quadrophenia , built on this sound before Who Are You , their last album before the death of pioneering rock drummer Keith Moon later that year..",
    "The mixture of hard rock and progressive rock, evident in the works of Deep Purple, was pursued more directly by bands like Uriah Heep and Argent. Scottish band Nazareth released their self-titled début album in 1971, producing a blend of hard rock and pop that would culminate in their best selling, Hair of the Dog , which contained the proto-power ballad \"Love Hurts\". Having enjoyed some national success in the early 1970s, Queen, after the release of Sheer Heart Attack  and A Night at the Opera , gained international recognition with a sound that used layered vocals and guitars and mixed hard rock with heavy metal, progressive rock, and even opera. The latter featured the hit single \"Bohemian Rhapsody\"..",
    "1 position on the Billboard 200 albums chart in 1973. Also in 1973, blues rockers ZZ Top released their classic album Tres Hombres and Aerosmith produced their eponymous début, as did Southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd and proto-punk outfit New York Dolls, demonstrating the diverse directions being pursued in the genre. Montrose, including the instrumental talent of Ronnie Montrose and vocals of Sammy Hagar released their first album in 1973. Former bubblegum-pop family act the Osmonds recorded two hard rock albums in 1972 and had their breakthrough in the UK with the hard rock hit \"Crazy Horses.\" Kiss built on the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the look of the New York Dolls to produce a unique band persona, achieving their commercial breakthrough with the double live album Alive! in 1975 and helping to take hard rock into the stadium rock era. In the mid-1970s Aerosmith achieved their commercial and artistic breakthrough with Toys in the Attic  and Rocks , Blue Öyster Cult, formed in the late 1960s, picked up on some of the elements introduced by Black Sabbath with their breakthrough live gold album On Your Feet or on Your Knees , followed by their first platinum album, Agents of Fortune , containing the hit single \" The Reaper\". Journey released their eponymous debut in 1975 and the next year Boston released their highly successful début album. In the same year, hard rock bands featuring women saw commercial success as Heart released Dreamboat Annie and the Runaways débuted with their self-titled album.",
    "While Heart had a more folk-oriented hard rock sound, the Runaways leaned more towards a mix of punk-influenced music and hard rock. The Amboy Dukes, having emerged from the Detroit garage rock scene and most famous for their psychedelic hit \"Journey to the Center of the Mind\" , were dissolved by their guitarist Ted Nugent, who embarked on a solo career that resulted in four successive multi-platinum albums between Ted Nugent  and his best selling Double Live Gonzo! . \"Goodbye to Love\" by The Carpenters, a duo whose music was otherwise almost exclusively soft rock, drew hate mail for its incorporation of a hard rock fuzz guitar solo by Tony Peluso..",
    "From outside the United Kingdom and the United States, the Canadian trio Rush released three distinctively hard rock albums in 1974–75  before moving toward a more progressive sound with the 1976 album 2112. Also from Canada, Triumph released their debut album in 1976 before their breakthrough came in the form of the Just a Game album in 1979.",
    "The Irish band Thin Lizzy, which had formed in the late 1960s, made their most substantial commercial breakthrough in 1976 with the hard rock album Jailbreak and their worldwide hit \"The Boys Are Back in Town\".",
    "They reached their commercial, and arguably their artistic peak with Black Rose: A Rock Legend . The arrival of the Scorpions from Germany marked the geographical expansion of the subgenre. Australian-formed AC/DC, with a stripped back, riff heavy and abrasive style that also appealed to the punk generation, began to gain international attention from 1976, culminating in the release of their multi-platinum albums Let There Be Rock  and Highway to Hell . Also influenced by a punk ethos were heavy metal bands like Motörhead, while Judas Priest abandoned the remaining elements of the blues in their music, further differentiating the hard rock and heavy metal styles and helping to create the new wave of British heavy metal which was pursued by bands like Iron Maiden, Saxon, and Venom..",
    "With the rise of disco in the US and punk rock in the UK, hard rock's mainstream dominance was rivalled toward the later part of the decade.",
    "Disco appealed to a more diverse group of people and punk seemed to take over the rebellious role that hard rock once held. Early punk bands like the Ramones explicitly rebelled against the drum solos and extended guitar solos that characterised stadium rock, with almost all of their songs clocking in under three minutes with no guitar solos. However, new rock acts continued to emerge and record sales remained high into the 1980s.",
    "He popularised a guitar-playing technique of two-handed hammer-ons and pull-offs called tapping, showcased on the song \"Eruption\" from the album Van Halen, which was highly influential in re-establishing hard rock as a popular genre after the punk and disco explosion, while also redefining and elevating the role of electric guitar. In the 1970s and 80s, several European bands, including the German Michael Schenker Group, the Swedish band Europe, and Dutch bands Golden Earring, Vandenberg and Vengeance experienced success both in Europe and internationally.",
    "The opening years of the 1980s saw a number of changes in personnel and direction of established hard rock acts, including the deaths of Bon Scott, the lead singer of AC/DC, and John Bonham, drummer with Led Zeppelin. Whereas Zeppelin broke up almost immediately afterwards, AC/DC pressed on, recording the album Back in Black  with their new lead singer, Brian Johnson."

    "The Zeeman slower is attached close to where the hot atoms exit the oven and is used to slow them to less than 10 m/s  with a very small velocity spread .",
    "A Zeeman slower consists of a cylinder, through which an atomic beam travels, a pump laser that counterpropagates with respect to the beam's direction , and a magnetic field  that points along the cylinder's axis with a spatially varying magnitude.",
    "The spatially varying magnetic field is designed to Zeeman shift the resonant frequency to match the decreasing Doppler shift as the atoms are slowed to lower velocities while they propagate through the Zeeman slower allowing pump laser to be continuously resonant and provide a slowing force.",

    "Phillips . The achievement of these low temperatures led the way for the experimental realization of Bose–Einstein condensation, and a Zeeman slower can be part of such an apparatus.",
    "The Zeeman slower uses the fact that a magnetic field can change the resonance frequency of an atom using the Zeeman effect to tackle this problem.",
    "The most common approach is to require that we have a magnetic field profile that varies in the\ndirection such that the atoms experience a constant acceleration\nas they fly along the axis of the slower.",
    "If a Zeeman slower were to be operated with\n, then after absorbing a photon and moving to the excited state, the atom would then preferentially re-emit a photon in the direction of the laser beam  which would counteract the slowing process.",

    "In the sport of cricket, a slower ball is a slower-than-usual delivery from a fast bowler.",
    "The slower ball, also known as the 'Wandi ball' technique was popularised in response to the demands of limited-overs cricket, not only to get wickets but also to slow down the scoring rate, as a slower ball will not carry to the boundary as easily as a normal fast delivery if it is hit square or behind the wicket.",
    "To be effective, the slower ball must be directed at or near the stumps in order to force the batsman to play, and the bowler's action must appear entirely normal.",
    "Although a slower ball is usually the result when a bowler tries a change of pace, some bowlers have a delivery which is even faster.",

University of Washington professor Michele Poff argued that Gore was successful in communicating to conservative-leaning audiences by framing the climate crisis as apolitical. \"Gore's and the environment's identification with the Democratic Party posed a significant challenge to reaching Republicans and conservatives, as well as those disgruntled with politics in general,\" Poff wrote.",

The judge ruled that An Inconvenient Truth contained nine scientific errors and thus must be accompanied by an explanation of those errors before being shown to school children.",

    "The horse  is a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed mammal.",
    "The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today.",
    "Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BCE, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BCE.",
    "Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses.",
    "These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated.",
    "Horses are adapted to run, allowing them to quickly escape predators, and possess an excellent sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response.",
    "Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults. Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth.",
    "Most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four.",
    "Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited \"hot bloods\" with speed and endurance; \"cold bloods\", such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and \"warmbloods\", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe.",
    "There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses.",
    "Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits as well as in working activities such as police work, agriculture, entertainment, and therapy.",
    "Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed, using many different styles of equipment and methods of control.",
    "Many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares.",
    "Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water, and shelter as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers.",
    "Depending on breed, management and environment, the modern domestic horse has a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years. Uncommonly, a few animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, beyond. The oldest verifiable record was \"Old Billy\", a 19th-century horse that lived to the age of 62. In modern times, Sugar Puff, who had been listed in Guinness World Records as the world's oldest living pony, died in 2007 at age 56..",
    "Regardless of a horse or pony's actual birth date, for most competition purposes a year is added to its age each January 1 of each year in the Northern Hemisphere and each August 1 in the Southern Hemisphere. The exception is in endurance riding, where the minimum age to compete is based on the animal's actual calendar age..",
    "The following terminology is used to describe horses of various ages:.",
    "In horse racing, these definitions may differ: For example, in the British Isles, Thoroughbred horse racing defines colts and fillies as less than five years old. However, Australian Thoroughbred racing defines colts and fillies as less than four years old..",
    "The height of horses is measured at the highest point of the withers, where the neck meets the back. This point is used because it is a stable point of the anatomy, unlike the head or neck, which move up and down in relation to the body of the horse.",
    "In English-speaking countries, the height of horses is often stated in units of hands and inches: one hand is equal to 4 inches .",
    "Thus, a horse described as \"15.2 h\" is 15 hands plus 2 inches, for a total of 62 inches  in height..",
    "The size of horses varies by breed, but also is influenced by nutrition.",
    "Light-riding horses usually range in height from 14 to 16 hands  and can weigh from 380 to 550 kilograms . Larger-riding horses usually start at about 15.2 hands  and often are as tall as 17 hands , weighing from 500 to 600 kilograms . Heavy or draft horses are usually at least 16 hands  high and can be as tall as 18 hands  high.",
    "The largest horse in recorded history was probably a Shire horse named Mammoth, who was born in 1848.",
    "He stood 21.2\n1⁄4 hands  high and his peak weight was estimated at 1,524 kilograms . The record holder for the smallest horse ever is Thumbelina, a fully mature miniature horse affected by dwarfism.",
    "Ponies are taxonomically the same animals as horses.",
    "The distinction between a horse and pony is commonly drawn on the basis of height, especially for competition purposes.",
    "However, height alone is not dispositive; the difference between horses and ponies may also include aspects of phenotype, including conformation and temperament.",
    "The traditional standard for height of a horse or a pony at maturity is 14.2 hands .",
    "An animal 14.2 hands  or over is usually considered to be a horse and one less than 14.2 hands  a pony, but there are many exceptions to the traditional standard."

    "To be more hydrodynamically effective, swimmers can either increase the power of their strokes or reduce water resistance, though power must increase by a factor of three to achieve the same effect as reducing resistance. Efficient swimming by reducing water resistance involves a horizontal water position, rolling the body to reduce the breadth of the body in the water, and extending the arms as far as possible to reduce wave resistance..",

    "There are four main strokes used in competition and recreation swimming: the front crawl, also known as freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke and butterfly.",
    "Competitive swimming in Europe started around 1800, mostly using the breaststroke.",
    "In 1873, John Arthur Trudgen introduced the trudgen to Western swimming competitions. Butterfly was developed in the 1930s, and was considered a variant of the breaststroke until accepted as a separate style in 1953. Butterfly is considered the hardest stroke by many people, but it is the most effective for all-around toning and the building of muscles. It also burns the most calories and can be the second fastest stroke if practiced regularly..",
    "In non-competitive swimming, there are some swimming strokes including sidestroke.",
    "It is still used in lifesaving and recreational swimming.",
    "Other strokes exist for particular reasons such as training, school lessons, and rescue, and it is often possible to change strokes to avoid using parts of the body, either to separate specific body parts, such as swimming with only arms or legs to exercise them harder, or for amputees or those affected by paralysis.",
    "Swimming has been recorded since prehistoric times, and the earliest records of swimming date back to Stone Age paintings from around 7,000 years ago.",
    "In 1538, Nikolaus Wynmann, a Swiss–German professor of languages, wrote the earliest known complete book about swimming, Colymbetes, sive de arte natandi dialogus et festivus et iucundus lectu ..",
    "There are many reasons why people swim, from swimming as a recreational pursuit to swimming as a necessary part of a job or other activity.",
    "Swimming may also be used to rehabilitate injuries, especially various cardiovascular and muscle injuries.",
    "People may also pursue swimming as a career or field of interest.",
    "Many swimmers swim for recreation, with swimming consistently ranking as one of the physical activities people are most likely to take part in.",
    "Recreational swimming can also be used for exercise, relaxation or rehabilitation. The support of the water, and the reduction in impact, makes swimming accessible for people who are unable to undertake activities such as running.",
    "Swimming is one of the most relaxing activities, water is known to calm us and can help reduce stress.",
    "Swimming is primarily a cardiovascular/aerobic exercise due to the long exercise time, requiring a constant oxygen supply to the muscles, except for short sprints where the muscles work anaerobically.",
    "Furthermore, swimming can help tone and strengthen muscles. Swimming allows sufferers of arthritis to exercise affected joints without worsening their symptoms."

  "tight": [
    "Tight may refer to:.",
    "The tight end  is an offensive position in American football, arena football, and Canadian football.",
    "The tight end's role in any given offense depends on the preferences and philosophy of the head coach, offensive coordinator, and overall team dynamic.",
    "In some systems, the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman, rarely going out for passes.",
    "Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver, frequently taking advantage of the tight end's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary.",
    "Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in obvious passing situations.",
    "Offensive formations may have as few as zero or as many as three tight ends at one time.",
    "The advent of the tight end position is closely tied to the decline of the one-platoon system during the 1940s and '50s.",
    "Greater use of the tight end as a receiver in the 1960s both reflected and led to the emergence of stars at the position such as Mike Ditka, Jackie Smith, and John Mackey. In addition to superb blocking, Ditka offered great hands receiving and rugged running after the catch.",
    "This leads all tight ends in the Hall of Fame and is even ahead of a significant number of wide receivers enshrined there..",
    "Still, tight ends remained primarily blockers lined up next to an offensive tackle and given short to medium drag routes. Starting in 1980 the Air Coryell offense began using tight end Kellen Winslow in wide receiver-type routes.",
    "Providing them another defender to help cover Winslow opened up holes for other receivers. Winslow would line up unpredictably in any formation, variously in a three point blocking stance, two point receiver's stance, or put in motion like a flanker or offensive back. Head coach Jon Gruden referred to such multi-dimensional tight ends as \"jokers\", calling Winslow the first ever in the NFL. Patriots head coach Bill Belichick notes that the pass-catching tight ends that get paid the most are \"all direct descendants of Kellen Winslow\", and there are fewer tight ends now that can block on the line..",
    "In the 1990s, Shannon Sharpe's athletic prowess as a route-runner helped change the way tight ends were used by teams.",
    "Consistently double-covered as a receiver, he became the first tight end in NFL history to rack up over 10,000 career receiving yards.",
    "Tony Gonzalez and Antonio Gates, who both played basketball in college, pushed the position toward wide receiver speed and power forward strength and wingspan. At 6'6\" Rob Gronkowski brought height, setting single-season tight end records in 2011 with 17 touchdowns—breaking Gates's and Vernon Davis's record of 13—and 1,327 receiving yards, surpassing Winslow's record of 1,290. Jimmy Graham that season also passed Winslow with 1,310 yards. Six of the NFL's 15 players with the most receptions that year were tight ends, the most in NFL history.",
    "Tight ends generally hit their peak between the ages of 25 and 30..",
    "In the Arena Football League the tight end serves as the 3rd offensive lineman .",
    "However, in Canadian football, tight ends are, in general, no longer used professionally in the CFL, but are still used at the college level in U Sports. Tony Gabriel is a former great tight end in Canadian football. There remain some tight ends in use at university level football; Antony Auclair, formerly a tight end for the Laval Rouge et Or, was a contender to be selected in the 2017 CFL Draft or possibly receive a tryout in the NFL. He was drafted by the CFL's Saskatchewan Roughriders in 2017, but instead signed with the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an undrafted free agent that same year.",
    "Tight ends have two primary roles:  act as a blocker and  act as a receiver.",
    "Very occasionally, a tight end is also given the opportunity to rush with the ball.",
    "In the National Football League , the tight end is larger, stronger, and slower than a wide receiver, and therefore able to block more effectively. Among offensive ball-handlers it is the job of the tight end, along with the fullback, to block for both running backs and receivers.",
    "Tight ends are used as blockers to protect the quarterback during passing plays, to open holes in the line, and downfield to tie up linebackers and defensive backs.",
    "Historically, a single tight end was used, typically placed on the right side of the offensive line.",
    "In the early 2000s two tight end formations began to be used with more frequency. Specialty plays may deploy 3- or 4-tight-end sets in \"heavy\" or \"jumbo\" packages, usually to block in short-yardage situations or to sew confusion in the defensive backfield with such an unusual formation.",
    "When a blocker larger than a tight end is desired without sacrificing they player's ability to catch a pass the position is sometimes filled by an offensive lineman who reports to the referee that he is an eligible receiver, referred to colloquially as a \"tackle eligible\".",
    "Historically, the primary role of a tight end was blocking, with strategic use as a receiver.",
    "Over time the emphasis of offense has shifted from running to passing, and with it the role of the tight end as a receiver expanded.",
    "The tight end is usually faster than the linebackers who cover him and often stronger than the cornerbacks and safeties who try to tackle him.",
    "In general, there is an inherent trade-off between a tight end's speed and agility and their size, meaning more mobile tight ends tend not to be as effective as blockers.",
    "This results in great premiums being placed on tight ends that can fill both roles effectively."

    "Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century.",
    "Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current range.",
    "DNA analysis from a more recent study indicates, that Central African lions are derived from both northern and southern lions, as they cluster with P.",
    "Lion samples from some parts of the Ethiopian Highlands cluster genetically with those from Cameroon and Chad, while lions from other areas of Ethiopia cluster with samples from East Africa.",

The earliest fossils recognisable as lions were found at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania and are estimated to be up to 2 million years old..",
    "There is no evidence for gene flow between the two lineages, indicating that they did not share the same geographic area. The Eurasian and American cave lions became extinct at the end of the last glacial period without mitochondrial descendants on other continents. The modern lion was probably widely distributed in Africa during the Middle Pleistocene and started to diverge in sub-Saharan Africa during the Late Pleistocene.",
    "As the rainforest decreased and thus gave rise to more open habitats, lions moved from West to Central Africa.",
    "Lions from North Africa dispersed to southern Europe and Asia between 38,800 and 8,300 years ago..",
    "Extinction of lions in southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East interrupted gene flow between lion populations in Asia and Africa.",
    "In zoos, lions have been bred with tigers to create hybrids for the curiosity of visitors or for scientific purpose. The liger is bigger than a lion and a tiger, whereas most tigons are relatively small compared to their parents because of reciprocal gene effects. The leopon is a hybrid between a lion and leopard..",
    "The tail of all lions ends in a dark, hairy tuft that in some lions conceals an approximately 5 mm -long, hard \"spine\" or \"spur\" that is formed from the final, fused sections of tail bone.",
    "The size and weight of adult lions varies across global range and habitats. Accounts of a few individuals that were larger than average exist from Africa and India..",
    "The male lion's mane is the most recognisable feature of the species. It may have evolved around 320,000–190,000 years ago. It starts growing when lions are about a year old.",
    "In Serengeti National Park, female lions favour males with dense, dark manes as mates.",
    "Cool ambient temperature in European and North American zoos may result in a heavier mane. Asiatic lions usually have sparser manes than average African lions..",
    "Almost all male lions in Pendjari National Park are either maneless or have very short manes. Maneless lions have also been reported in Senegal, in Sudan's Dinder National Park and in Tsavo East National Park, Kenya. The original male white lion from Timbavati in South Africa was also maneless.",
    "The hormone testosterone has been linked to mane growth; castrated lions often have little to no mane because the removal of the gonads inhibits testosterone production. Increased testosterone may be the cause of maned lionesses reported in northern Botswana..",
    "White lions have occasionally been encountered in and around Kruger National Park and the adjacent Timbavati Private Game Reserve in eastern South Africa.",
    "Nevertheless, 17 births have been recorded in five prides between 2007 and 2015. White lions are selected for breeding in captivity. They have reportedly been bred in camps in South Africa for use as trophies to be killed during canned hunts..",
    "African lions live in scattered populations across sub-Saharan Africa.",
    "Lions spend much of their time resting; they are inactive for about twenty hours per day. Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming and defecating.",
    "Groups of male lions are called \"coalitions\". Females form the stable social unit in a pride and do not tolerate outside females. Membership changes only with the births and deaths of lionesses, although some females leave and become nomadic. The average pride consists of around 15 lions, including several adult females and up to four males and their cubs of both sexes.",
    "Some lions are \"nomads\" that range widely and move around sporadically, either in pairs or alone. Pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from their birth pride.",
    "A lion may switch lifestyles; nomads can become residents and vice versa. Interactions between prides and nomads tend to be hostile, although pride females in estrus allow nomadic males to approach them. Males spend years in a nomadic phase before gaining residence in a pride. A study undertaken in the Serengeti National Park revealed that nomadic coalitions gain residency at between 3.5 and 7.3 years of age. In Kruger National Park, dispersing male lions move more than 25 km  away from their natal pride in search of their own territory.",

    "In the English-speaking world during most of the 20th century, Ukraine  was referred to as \"the Ukraine\". This is because the word ukraina means \"borderland\" so the definite article would be natural in the English language; this is similar to \"Nederlanden\", which means \"low lands\" and is rendered in English as \"the Netherlands\". However, since Ukraine's declaration of independence in 1991, this usage has become politicised and is now rarer, and style guides advise against its use. US ambassador William Taylor said that using \"the Ukraine\" implies disregard for Ukrainian sovereignty.

After the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 1783, the newly acquired lands, now called Novorossiya, were opened up to settlement by Russians. The tsarist autocracy established a policy of Russification, suppressing the use of the Ukrainian language and curtailing the Ukrainian national identity.

Other than near the newly discovered coal fields of the Donbas, and in some larger cities such as Odesa and Kyiv, Ukraine largely remained an agricultural and resource extraction economy.

    "An attempt to create an independent state, the left-leaning Ukrainian People's Republic , was first announced by Mykhailo Hrushevsky, but the period was plagued by an extremely unstable political and military environment.",
    "It was first deposed in a coup d'état led by Pavlo Skoropadskyi, which yielded the Ukrainian State under the German protectorate, and the attempt to restore the UNR under the Directorate ultimately failed as the Ukrainian army was regularly overrun by other forces.",
    "The short-lived West Ukrainian People's Republic and Hutsul Republic also failed to join the rest of Ukraine..",
    "The result of the conflict was a partial victory for the Second Polish Republic, which annexed the Western Ukrainian provinces, as well as a larger-scale victory for the pro-Soviet forces, which succeeded in dislodging the remaining factions and eventually established the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic .",
    "In Poland, Marshal Józef Piłsudski and his political allies wanted to gain Ukrainian support by offering limited local autonomy as way to minimise Soviet influences in the borderlands. However, this approach was abandoned after Piłsudski's death in 1935, due to continued unrest among the Ukrainian population, with the Polish government responding by restricting rights of people who declared Ukrainian nationality and belonged to the Eastern Orthodox Church. In consequence, an underground Ukrainian nationalist and militant movement arose in the 1920s and 1930s, which gradually transformed into the Ukrainian Military Organization and later the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists .",
    "During the 1920s, under the Ukrainisation policy pursued by the national Communist leadership of Mykola Skrypnyk, Soviet leadership at first encouraged a national renaissance in Ukrainian culture and language.",
    "The NEP was successful at restoring the formerly war-torn nation to pre-WWI levels of production and agricultural output by the mid-1920s, much of the latter based in Ukraine. These policies attracted many prominent former UNR figures, including former UNR leader Hrushevsky, to return to Soviet Ukraine, where they were accepted, and participated in the advancement of Ukrainian science and culture..",
    "However, as a consequence of Stalin's new policy, the Ukrainian peasantry suffered from the programme of collectivization of agricultural crops.",
    "Following on the Russian Civil War, and collectivisation, the Great Purge, while killing Stalin's perceived political enemies, resulted in a profound loss of a new generation of Ukrainian intelligentsia, known today as the Executed Renaissance..",
    "Thus, Eastern Galicia and Volhynia with their Ukrainian population became part of Ukraine.",
    "For the first time in history, the nation was united. Further territorial gains were secured in 1940, when the Ukrainian SSR incorporated the northern and southern districts of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and the Hertsa region from the territories the USSR forced Romania to cede, though it handed over the western part of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic to the newly created Moldavian SSR.",
    "More than 600,000 Soviet soldiers  were killed or taken captive there, with many suffering severe mistreatment. After its conquest, most of the Ukrainian SSR was organised within the Reichskommissariat Ukraine, with the intention of exploiting its resources and eventual German settlement.",
    "Some western Ukrainians, who had only joined the Soviet Union in 1939, hailed the Germans as liberators, but that did not last long as the Nazis made little attempt to exploit dissatisfaction with Stalinist policies. Instead, the Nazis preserved the collective-farm system, carried out genocidal policies against Jews, deported millions of people to work in Germany, and began a depopulation program to prepare for German colonisation. They blockaded the transport of food on the Dnieper River.."

    "The randomness of the whole shuffle is increased by the number of small packets in each shuffle and the number of repeat shuffles performed.",
    "The overhand shuffle offers sufficient opportunity for sleight of hand techniques to be used to affect the ordering of cards, creating a stacked deck.",
    "The most common way that players cheat with the overhand shuffle is by having a card at the top or bottom of the pack that they require, and then slipping it to the bottom at the start of a shuffle , or leaving it as the last card in a shuffle and just dropping it on top .",
    "A common shuffling technique is called the riffle, or dovetail shuffle or leafing the cards, in which half of the deck is held in each hand with the thumbs inward, then cards are released by the thumbs so that they fall to the table interleaved.",
    "While this method is more difficult, it is often used in casinos because it minimizes the risk of exposing cards during the shuffle.",
    "There are two types of perfect riffle shuffles: if the top card moves to be second from the top then it is an in shuffle, otherwise it is known as an out shuffle .",
    "Also known as the \"Indian\", \"Kattar\", \"Kenchi\"  or \"Kutti Shuffle\".",
    "Indian shuffle differs from stripping in that all the action is in the hand taking the cards, whereas in stripping, the action is performed by the hand with the original deck, giving the cards to the resulting pile.",
    "This is the most common shuffling technique in Asia and other parts of the world, while the overhand shuffle is primarily used in Western countries.",
    "Some variations on the pile shuffle attempt to make it slightly random by dealing to the piles in a random order each circuit.",
    "Also known as the Chemmy, Irish, wash, scramble, beginner shuffle, smooshing, schwirsheling, or washing the cards, this involves simply spreading the cards out face down, and sliding them around and over each other with one's hands.",

    "The faro is a controlled shuffle which does not randomize a deck when performed properly.",
    "A perfect faro shuffle, where the cards are perfectly alternated, is considered one of the most difficult sleights by card magicians, simply because it requires the shuffler to be able to cut the deck into two equal packets and apply just the right amount of pressure when pushing the cards into each other.",
    "Performing eight perfect faro shuffles in a row restores the order of the deck to the original order only if there are 52 cards in the deck and if the original top and bottom cards remain in their positions  during the eight shuffles.",

    "The Mexican spiral shuffle was popular at the end of the 19th century in some areas of Mexico as a protection from gamblers and con men arriving from the United States.",
    "Magicians, sleight-of-hand artists, and card cheats employ various methods of shuffling whereby the deck appears to have been shuffled fairly, when in reality one or more cards  stays in the same position.",

Outside of these areas, a limited amount of Slavic settlement is generally thought to have occurred, although on a much smaller scale than previously thought.

For example, Rhea Seehorn's performance as Kim Wexler during the first season significantly altered how the writers used her character in later seasons as well as slowing down the pacing of the transition of Jimmy into Saul, as they gave more focus to the Jimmy–Kim relationship.",

    "In his report, one of his recommendations was that colonies which were developed enough should be granted \"responsible government\".",
    "The first instance of responsible government in the British Empire outside of the United Kingdom itself was achieved by the colony of Nova Scotia in January–February 1848 through the efforts of Joseph Howe.",
    "Howe's push for responsible government was inspired by the work of Thomas McCulloch and Jotham Blanchard almost two decades earlier. The plaque in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly erected by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada reads:.",
    "In the Province of Canada, responsible government was introduced with the ministry of Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine and Robert Baldwin in spring 1848; it was put to the test in 1849, when Reformers in the legislature passed the Rebellion Losses Bill.",
    "Nonetheless, the Rebellion Losses Bill helped entrench responsible government into Canadian politics.",
    "In time, the granting of responsible government became the first step on the road to complete independence.",
    "However this did nothing towards establishing responsible or representative government.",
    "The most violent move towards responsible government occurred in the Colony of Victoria during the 1850s where there was growing discontent and civil disobedience, especially in the inland gold fields areas.",
    "However, mass public support led to the miners' release and, within a year, most of their demands had been met, including responsible self-government and universal male suffrage for the Colony of Victoria.",
    "By the end of the 1850s, all the Australian colonies and New Zealand had achieved responsible self-government, aside from Western Australia which took until 1890.",
    "It then lost responsible self-government  and only gained it back in 1974.",
    "It was transferred to the Commonwealth Government in 1911 and lost responsible self-government until 1989.",
    "Female suffrage  was gained in 1890s-1910s in Australia and New Zealand , allowing the other half of the population to participate in responsible representative government.",
    "The Cape Colony, in Southern Africa, was under responsible self-government from 1872 until 1910 when it became the Cape Province of the new Union of South Africa..",
    "A popular political movement for responsible government soon emerged, under local leader John Molteno.",
    "A protracted struggle was then conducted over the ensuing years as the movement  grew increasingly powerful, and used their parliamentary majority to put pressure on the British Governor, withholding public finances from him, and conducting public agitations.",
    "Not everyone favoured responsible government though, and pro-imperial press outlets even accused the movement of constituting \"crafts and assaults of the devil\".."

    "Jumping or leaping is a form of locomotion or movement in which an organism or non-living  mechanical system propels itself through the air along a ballistic trajectory.",
    "Jumping can be distinguished from running, galloping and other gaits where the entire body is temporarily airborne, by the relatively long duration of the aerial phase and high angle of initial launch.",

    "Jumping is also a key feature of various activities and sports, including the long jump, high jump and show jumping.",
    "All jumping involves the application of force against a substrate, which in turn generates a reactive force that propels the jumper away from the substrate.",
    "Jumping organisms are rarely subject to significant aerodynamic forces and, as a result, their jumps are governed by the basic physical laws of ballistic trajectories.",
    "Consequently, while a bird may jump into the air to initiate flight, no movement it performs once airborne is considered jumping, as the initial jump conditions no longer dictate its flight path.",
    "As a result, many jumping animals have long legs and muscles that are optimized for maximal power according to the force-velocity relationship of muscles.",
    "To circumvent this limitation, many jumping species slowly pre-stretch elastic elements, such as tendons or apodemes, to store work as strain energy.",
    "Animals use a wide variety of anatomical adaptations for jumping.",
    "Aquatic species rarely display any particular specializations for jumping.",
    "Typical characteristics of jumping species include long legs, large leg muscles, and additional limb elements.",
    "Long legs increase the time and distance over which a jumping animal can push against the substrate, thus allowing more power and faster, farther jumps.",
    "Large leg muscles can generate greater force, resulting in improved jumping performance.",
    "In addition to elongated leg elements, many jumping animals have modified foot and ankle bones that are elongated and possess additional joints, effectively adding more segments to the limb and even more length.",

    "The use of elastic energy storage has been found in jumping mammals as well as in frogs, with commensurate increases in power ranging from two to seven times that of equivalent muscle mass..",

    "\"The Look\" is a song by Swedish pop duo Roxette.",
    "It was released in early 1989 as the fourth single from their second studio album, Look Sharp! .",
    "The duo released their second album Look Sharp! in October 1988.",
    "\"The Look\" was written by Per Gessle as an exercise while learning how to operate the Ensoniq ESQ-1 synthesizer he had recently purchased, using a repeated A–G–D bass line as the song's core. The track's sixteenth-note rhythm was inspired by the work of ZZ Top. The first two verses are composed of guide lyrics, with Gessle explaining he \"scribbled  down instantly just to remember the rhythm.",
    "A demo for the song was recorded at the Tits & Ass Studio in Halmstad in March 1988. The original title was \"He's Got the Look\", with the lyrics using male pronouns. Gessle said this was done because he initially wanted Marie Fredriksson to sing the track. Both he and EMI Sweden had chosen to highlight Fredriksson as Roxette's lead vocalist. However, when recording the demo, Gessle realised the song \"didn't fit her style that well, so I had a go and it sounded OK.\" He said the song immediately had a \"special power\", saying that the demo \"stood out; it was a great song.",
    "Upon playing the riff during the recording of \"The Look\", Isacsson said Gessle, producer Clarence Öfwerman and engineer Alar Suurna \"went bonkers\", and that Gessle \"instantly wanted it as opening riff for the song.\".",
    "\"The Look\" was issued in Sweden on 12 January 1989, as the third single from Look Sharp! in that country. The track was an immediate commercial success there, peaking at number six and spending almost two months in the top ten of the then-fortnightly Sverigetopplistan chart. The song was certified gold by the Swedish Recording Industry Association for shipments in excess of 25,000 units. Around the same time, an American exchange student from Minnesota named Dean Cushman returned from Sweden and gave his copy of the album to his local Top 40 radio station, KDWB-FM in Minneapolis. The station's program director Brian Phillips initially ignored Cushman's request to play a song from the album, leaving the CD unplayed in his office for several weeks.",
    "Immediately impressed by the album's opening track, \"The Look\" was played by the station for the first time on US radio less than an hour later, and the response from listeners was overwhelmingly positive; the station immediately began receiving phone calls to replay the track..",
    "KDWB began distributing the track to their sister radio operations, sending 500 copies to other stations throughout the United States. EMI America promptly signed the duo to a recording contract as a result of the airplay. The label had previously rejected Roxette as \"unsuitable for the American market\". The song had already entered the top fifty of the Billboard Hot 100 before official promotion began, peaking at number one on the chart eight weeks later. This made \"The Look\" the third number one single by a Swedish act on the Billboard Hot 100, following Blue Swede's \"Hooked on a Feeling\" in 1974 and ABBA's \"Dancing Queen\" in 1976..",
    "The track went on to top the charts in 25 countries. It spent three weeks atop the New Zealand Singles Chart, and six weeks at number one in Australia, where it was certified platinum for sales in excess of 70,000 copies. It also topped the charts throughout Scandinavia, peaking at number one in Denmark, Finland and Norway, and was certified gold in the former country for shipments in excess of 45,000 units. The song spent five weeks at number one in West Germany, and an additional five weeks at number two. The song was a massive success in Spain and Switzerland, spending eight weeks at number one in both countries. In the United Kingdom, where \"The Look\" was released on 13 March 1989, it reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart..",
    "Bill Coleman from Billboard said \"The Look\" was \"too catchy for words\", describing it as a \"pop track that incorporates an eager rock edge and funky rhythm underpinnings.\" A writer for Stereogum noted an inability to define the genre of the track, saying that despite its disparate influences, the song was neither rock, dance or funk.",
    "\"The Look\" was remixed in 1995 and re-released exclusively in the United Kingdom in conjunction with the release of their first greatest hits compilation, Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus! Roxette's Greatest Hits.",

    "And that's what the movie's literally about.\" At the film's premiere, Wolff was asked for his interpretation of the film and said it was \"an allegorical existential sort of meditation on getting older.\" Other cast members chimed in; Nikki Amuka-Bird said the film was about not taking nature for granted, Gael García Bernal said it was about questioning how time travels differently for other people, and Vicky Krieps found that it was about \"love and family and all these things that are much stronger than any fears — the fear of aging and the fear of death.\".",
    "On September 26, 2020, principal photography began in the Dominican Republic, and to celebrate, Shyamalan revealed the film's title and published its first promotional release poster. That same day, Collider reported that the film was an adaptation of Sandcastle, the French graphic novel by Swiss authors Pierre Oscar Levy and Frederik Peeters, which Shyamalan had received as a collective Father's Day gift from his three daughters in 2017. Old marks the first film of Shyamalan's career to have no shooting take place around his hometown of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. With an $18 million budget, filming took place during the COVID-19 pandemic with cinematographer Michael Gioulakis, using 35mm film, and concluded on November 15, 2020. After filming wrapped, Shyamalan said Old was the first film to be shot during the pandemic in the Dominican Republic and that throughout the shoot, no one tested positive for the virus as he paid for the production crew's ten-week stay at a hotel..",
    "Old was inspired by films created during the Australian New Wave, including Walkabout  and Picnic at Hanging Rock , along with The Exterminating Angel , Kuroneko , Jaws , and The Twilight Zone. To create a claustrophobic feeling, Shyamalan employed several filming techniques from Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon  and Ran . As a result, Old was mostly filmed in a single location, the Playa El Valle beach located between two mountains on the north coast of Santa Bárbara de Samaná.",
    "Old was originally going to be released by Universal Pictures on February 26, 2021, but in April 2020, the film was removed from the studio's release schedule after its film Nobody was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2020, Universal Pictures announced that Old would be theatrically released on July 23, 2021.

    "The Old Testament consists of many distinct books by various authors produced over a period of centuries. Christians traditionally divide the Old Testament into four sections: the first five books or Pentateuch ; the history books telling the history of the Israelites, from their conquest of Canaan to their defeat and exile in Babylon; the poetic and \"Wisdom books\" dealing, in various forms, with questions of good and evil in the world; and the books of the biblical prophets, warning of the consequences of turning away from God.",

  "uncompetitive": [
    "Uncompetitive inhibition, also known as anti-competitive inhibition, takes place when an enzyme inhibitor binds only to the complex formed between the enzyme and the substrate .",
    "Uncompetitive inhibition typically occurs in reactions with two or more substrates or products..",
    "While uncompetitive inhibition requires that an enzyme-substrate complex must be formed, non-competitive inhibition can occur with or without the substrate present.",
    "Uncompetitive inhibition is distinguished from competitive inhibition by two observations: first uncompetitive inhibition cannot be reversed by increasing  and second, as shown, the Lineweaver–Burk plot yields parallel rather than intersecting lines.",
    "In general, uncompetitive inhibition works best when substrate concentration is high.",
    "An uncompetitive inhibitor need not resemble the substrate of the reaction it is inhibiting.",
    "At no concentration of substrate will the activity of the enzyme be higher when an uncompetitive inhibitor is present, but at low concentrations of substrate the enzyme activity difference will be negligible..",
    "The Lineweaver–Burk plot for an uncompetitive inhibitor produces a line parallel to the original enzyme-substrate plot, but with a higher y-intercept, due to the presence of an inhibition term\n:.",
    "Thus, an uncompetitive inhibitor lowers the measured Vmax.",
    "Apparent Km also decreases, because  required to reach one-half Vmax decreases by the factor α'. It is important to note that Vmax and Km decrease at the same rate as a result of the inhibitor. This is apparent when viewing a Lineweaver-Burk plot of uncompetitive enzyme inhibition: the ratio between V and Km remains the same with or without an inhibitor present.",
    "The unique traits of uncompetitive inhibition lead to a variety of implications for the inhibition's effects within biological and biochemical systems.",
    "Uncompetitive inhibition is present within biological systems in a number of ways.",
    "In fact, it often becomes clear that the traits of inhibition specific to uncompetitive inhibitors, such as their tendency to act at their best at high concentrations of substrate, are essential to some important bodily functions operating properly..",
    "Uncompetitive mechanisms are involved with certain types of cancer.",
    "Human alkaline phosphatases such as CGAP have been found to be over-expressed in certain types of cancers, and those phosphatases often operate via uncompetitive inhibition.",
    "It has also been found that a number of the genes that code for human alkaline phosphatases  are inhibited uncompetitively by amino acids such as leucine and phenylalanine. Studies of the involved amino acid residues have been undertaken in attempts to regulate alkaline phosphatase activity and learn more about said activity's relevance to cancer..",
    "Additionally, uncompetitive inhibition works alongside TP53 to help repress the activity of cancer cells and prevent tumorigenesis in certain forms of the illness, as it inhibits G6PD .",
    "When G6PD's substrate concentration is high, uncompetitive inhibition of the enzyme becomes far more effective. As substrate concentration increases, the amount of ES complex increases as well, and with more ES complex to bind, uncompetitive inhibitors become far more active.",
    "At low initial substrate concentrations, increasing the concentration of substrate is sometimes enough to entirely or even fully restore the enzyme's function, but as soon as initial concentration increases past a certain point, reaching the maximal enzyme velocity is all but impossible. This extreme sensitivity to substrate concentration within the cancer mechanism implicates uncompetitive inhibition rather than mixed inhibition, which displays similar traits but is often less sensitive to substrate concentration due to some inhibitor binding to free enzymes regardless of the substrate's presence. As such, the extreme strength of uncompetitive inhibitors at high substrate concentrations and the overall sensitivity to substrate amount indicates that only uncompetitive inhibition can make this type of process possible.",
    "For example, active sites capable of uncompetitive inhibition appear to be present in membranes, as removing lipids from cell membranes and making active sites more accessible through conformational changes has been shown to invoke elements resembling the effects of uncompetitive inhibition (i.e.",
    "In mitochondrial membrane lipids specifically, removing lipids decreases the alpha-helix content in mitochondria and leads to changes in ATPase resembling uncompetitive inhibition..",
    "This presence of uncompetitive enzymes in membranes has also been supported in a number of other studies.",

    "Uncompetitive inhibition can play roles in various other parts of the body as well.",
    "Various uncompetitive blockers act as antagonists at the receptors and modify the process, with one example being an inhibitor called memantine. In fact, in similar cases , it has been shown that uncompetitive inhibition helps in nullifying the over-expression due to its particular properties.",
    "Since uncompetitive inhibitors block high concentrations of substrates very efficiently, their traits alongside the innate characteristics of the receptors themselves lead to very effective blocking of NMDA channels when they are excessively open due to massive amounts of NMDA agonists..",

    "Debugging ranges in complexity from fixing simple errors to performing lengthy and tiresome tasks of data collection, analysis, and scheduling updates.",
    "The debugging skill of the programmer can be a major factor in the ability to debug a problem, but the difficulty of software debugging varies greatly with the complexity of the system, and also depends, to some extent, on the programming language used and the available tools, such as debuggers.",

    "The term debugger can also refer to the person who is doing the debugging.",

    "An ICE may perform many of the typical software debugger's tasks on low-level software and firmware.",
    "The debugging process normally begins with identifying the steps to reproduce the problem.",

    "Singing can be formal or informal, arranged, or improvised.",
    "Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction, and regular practice.",
    "If practice is done regularly then the sounds can become clearer and stronger. Professional singers usually build their careers around one specific musical genre, such as classical or rock, although there are singers with crossover success .",
    "In its physical aspect, singing has a well-defined technique that depends on the use of the lungs, which act as an air supply or bellows; on the larynx, which acts as a reed or vibrator; on the chest, head cavities and the skeleton, which have the function of an amplifier, as the tube in a wind instrument; and on the tongue, which together with the palate, teeth, and lips articulate and impose consonants and vowels on the amplified sound.",
    "The sound of each individual's singing voice is entirely unique not only because of the actual shape and size of an individual's vocal cords, but also due to the size and shape of the rest of that person's body.",
    "Voice classification is the process by which human singing voices are evaluated and are thereby designated into voice types.",
    "Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal registration. The science behind voice classification developed within European classical music has been slow in adapting to more modern forms of singing.",
    "Either option can present problems for the singer, but for most singers, there are fewer dangers in singing too low than in singing too high..",
    "Attempts have been made to adopt classical voice type terms to other forms of singing but such attempts have been met with controversy. The development of voice categorizations were made with the understanding that the singer would be using classical vocal technique within a specified range using unamplified  vocal production.",
    "The first recorded mention of the terms chest voice and head voice was around the 13th century when it was distinguished from the \"throat voice\"  by the writers Johannes de Garlandia and Jerome of Moravia. The terms were later adopted within bel canto, the Italian opera singing method, where chest voice was identified as the lowest and head voice the highest of three vocal registers: the chest, passagio, and head registers. This approach is still taught by some vocal pedagogists today.",
    "Such pedagogists teach that the head register is a vocal technique used in singing to describe the resonance felt in the singer's head..",
    "However, as knowledge of physiology has increased over the past two hundred years, so has the understanding of the physical process of singing and vocal production.",
    "In classical singing, its use is limited entirely to the lower part of the modal register or normal voice.",

    "Speak Now is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on October 25, 2010, through Big Machine Records.",
    "Inspired by Swift's transition from adolescence into adulthood, Speak Now is a loose concept album about her confessions regarding love and heartache, with some songs about her public experiences.",
    "After the album's release, Swift embarked on the Speak Now World Tour, which visited Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania from February 2011 to March 2012.",
    "Speak Now peaked atop charts and received multi-platinum certifications in Australia  and Canada .",
    "Speak Now received generally positive reviews from music critics for offering emotional engagement and radio-friendly songs.",
    "At the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012, Speak Now was nominated for Best Country Album, and its third single \"Mean\" won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance.",
    "Critics have retrospectively named Speak Now one of the best country albums of the 2010s and described its songs about Swift's public image a precedent to her songwriting on subsequent albums.",
    "That would happen again in New York and then again in Boston and that would happen again in Nashville.\" Swift was inspired by her growth into adulthood and conceived Speak Now as a loose concept album about things she never had a chance to tell people she had met. As with her songwriting for on past albums, Swift strove to convey emotional honesty, writing details as specifically as possible, believing it is important for a songwriter to do so. She described her songs as \"diary entries\" about her emotions that helped her navigate adulthood. Swift chose not to follow the trend of making increasingly sexualized music by artists of her age, believing such a path would be incongruent with her artistic vision..",
    "Departing from Fearless's theme of fairy tales and starry-eyed romance, Speak Now explores introspection and backward-looking reflections on relationships. Its songs expanding on Swift's romantic tropes are mostly about monogamous relationships without sexual references, keeping her \"good-girl\" image intact. Many were inspired by Swift's public experience, including past relationships with high-profile celebrities, which received media attention during the album's promotional rollout. The confessional lyrics of Speak Now are more direct and confrontational than those on Swift's past albums. On \"Back to December\", she asks an ex-lover to forgive her wrongdoings. \"Dear John\" narrates a devastating relationship of a 19-year-old female narrator who accuses a much-older man of manipulating her with \"dark, twisted games\". Swift's encounter with an ex-lover at an awards show, where they ignored each other despite Swift feeling a need to speak to him inspired \"The Story of Us\". On \"Better than Revenge\", Swift affirms vengeance against a romantic rival who is known for \"the things she does on the mattress\"..",
    "Romantic optimism is another major theme of the album. The opening track \"Mine\" is about Swift's hope of attaining happiness despite her tendency to \"run from love\" to avoid heartbreak. It was the first song she included on the track list because it represents her then-new perspective of romance. Swift had written \"Sparks Fly\"—a song about dangerous hints of love at first sight—before she released her 2006 self-titled debut album. She re-recorded the song for Speak Now after she received fan request to release it at the 2010 CMA Music Festival. \"Enchanted\" describes the aftermath of an encounter with a special person without knowing whether the infatuation would be reciprocated. \"Haunted\" is about romantic obsession and \"Last Kiss\" explores the lingering feelings after a breakup. On \"Long Live\", Swift expresses gratitude to her fans and bandmates. The lyrics of \"Enchanted\" and \"Long Live\" incorporate high-school-prom and fairy-tale imagery that recalls the youthful optimism of Fearless..",
    "Swift wrote as many as 25 songs and by early 2010, she had begun to select songs for the album. To ensure the album would be coherent, she played the songs to her family, friends, and producer Nathan Chapman, who had produced for Swift since the recording of her self-titled debut album in 2006. Swift chose Enchanted as a working title but Big Machine Records executive Scott Borchetta recommended Swift choose a different title, deeming Enchanted unfit for the album's mature perspective. She settled on the title Speak Now, saying it best captures the album's essence: \"I think it's such a metaphor, that moment where it's almost too late, and you've got to either say what it is you are feeling or deal with the consequences forever ..",
    "And this album seemed like the opportunity for me to speak now or forever hold my peace.\" Swift finalized the track list by June 2010..",
    "Swift recorded much of Speak Now with Chapman at his Pain in the Art Studio in Nashville. Although Fearless's commercial success allowed Swift to engage a larger group of producers, she worked solely with Chapman, believing they had a productive relationship. The recording process started with a demo; Swift recorded vocals and played guitar, and Chapman sang background vocals and played other instruments.",
    "After arranging the demos, Swift and Chapman approached engineers and other musicians to tweak some elements, including overdubs and programmed drums. The first track Chapman produced with Swift on Speak Now is \"Mine\", which they recorded within five hours..",
    "Because of his artistic autonomy, Chapman said he was responsible for \"60 percent of the music on the album, including 90 percent of the guitars\". Much of his production for Speak Now is identical to that for Fearless; he programmed the drums with Toontrack's software Superior Drummer, played drums on the Roland Fantom G6 keyboard, added electric guitars to the arrangements, recorded Swift's vocals with an Avantone CV12 microphone and his background vocals with a Shure SM57, produced the bass with an Avalon VT737 preamplifier, and used Endless Audio's CLASP System to synchronize his editing on Pro Tools and Logic. Because of Swift's country-music vision, Chapman asked other musicians, mostly in Nashville, to replace his programmed drums with live drumming and add acoustic instruments such as fiddle. For instance, Chapman asked Steve Marcantonio to cut down programmed drums on \"Mine\" at Blackbird Studios in Nashville. For some tracks, including \"Back to December\", Swift and her team went to Capitol Studios in Los Angeles to record string orchestration..",
    "Within three weeks, Niebank finished mixing 17 tracks including 14 on the standard edition and three bonus tracks on the deluxe edition. Because Swift wanted Speak Now to be a direct communication with her audience, Niebank infused monoaural reverberation inspired by 1950s and 1960s music in the mix to evoke a \"vintage\" and \"retro\" vibe that, according to Niebank, brought a sense of authenticity. Music engineer Hank Williams mastered the recordings. Because much of Speak Now was recorded and mixed in Nashville, Niebank believed the album stood out among popular records that were manipulated with contemporaneous technologies Auto-Tune and Melodyne. Although Chapman was responsible for much of the production, he said Swift's co-production credit is \"not a vanity credit.",
    "Speak Now follows the country pop production of Fearless with increasing elements of mainstream pop music. Critics debated the album's genre.",
    "Paste described the album as a blend of country and radio-friendly pop tunes with climatic build-ups and catchy hooks. Entertainment Weekly classified the album as pop and commented the only country elements are its \"smattering of banjo pluck and dainty twang\". According to BBC Music, Speak Now veers towards pop rock. Ann Powers, in a review for the Los Angeles Times, found the album borderline alternative rock and bubblegum pop with its songs experimenting with styles from \"lush strings of Céline-style kitsch-pop to Americana banjo to countrypolitan electric guitar\". Now described Speak Now as \"slickly produced power pop\"..",
    "The remaining tracks of Speak Now are ballads.",
    "\"Back to December\" is a gentle, orchestral, string-laden ballad. Speak Now's longest track, \"Dear John\" at six minutes and 43 seconds, is a slow-burning, bluesy, country-pop song with electric guitar licks. The guitar ballad \"Never Grow Up\" incorporates an understated production that accompanies its wistful lyrics. On \"Enchanted\", the acoustic guitar crescendos after each refrain, leading up to a harmony-layered coda at the end. The tracks \"Innocent\" and \"Last Kiss\" incorporate sparse instruments; the latter is a slow-tempo waltz with breathy vocals. \"If This Was a Movie\", a bonus song on the deluxe edition and the only song not written solely by Swift, is a fast-paced ballad with a recurring guitar riff and simple harmonies..",
    "Swift announced details of Speak Now on July 20, 2010, in a live stream on Ustream. Big Machine Records released the lead single \"Mine\" to US country radio and digital download sites on August 3, 2010. The music video for \"Mine\" premiered on CMT on August 27, 2010. The single peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America . \"Mine\" reached number six in Japan, number seven in Canada, and number nine in Australia. On August 18, Swift released the album's cover art, which depicts Swift with curly hair and red lipstick twirling in a deep-purple gown. On September 15, Swift announced a Target-exclusive deluxe edition whose cover art is identical to that of the standard edition but the gown is red instead of purple. Starting from October 4, 2010, Swift released one Speak Now track each week on the iTunes Store as part of a three-week countdown campaign; the title track was released on October 5, followed by \"Back to December\" on October 12 and \"Mean\" on October 19. On October 22, Xfinity premiered a preview of \"The Story of Us\"..",
    "Big Machine Records released the standard and deluxe editions of Speak Now on October 25, 2010. The Target-exclusive CD+DVD edition contains 14 songs of the standard; the bonus tracks \"Ours\", \"If This Was a Movie\", and \"Superman\"; acoustic versions of \"Back to December\" and \"Haunted\"; a \"pop mix\" of \"Mine\"; a 30-minute behind-the-scenes video for \"Mine\"; and the music video for \"Mine\". The deluxe edition was released to other retailers on January 17, 2012. To bolster sales of the album, Swift had partnerships with Starbucks, Sony Electronics, Walmart, and Jakks Pacific. In October 2011, Swift partnered with Elizabeth Arden, Inc.",
    "To further promote Speak Now, Swift appeared on magazine covers and conducted press interviews. She performed \"Innocent\" at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards. Her other performances at awards shows include the Country Music Association Awards and the American Music Awards in 2010; the Academy of Country Music Awards and the Country Music Association Awards in 2011. Swift also appeared on many television shows and concert specials, performing at Nashville's Country Music Hall of Fame and X Factor Italy. She embarked on a promotional tour in Japan, appearing on variety show SMAPxSMAP and music program Music Station. Her round of American television shows included Today, Late Show with David Letterman, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Live with Regis and Kelly, and Dancing with the Stars. She also gave private concerts to contest winners, and played a semi-private concert for JetBlue at the John F.",
    "After \"Mine\", Swift released five more singles from Speak Now.",
    "On November 23, 2010, Swift announced the Speak Now World Tour, which started in Singapore on February 9, 2011.",
    "The tour visited Asia and Europe before the North American leg started in Omaha, Nebraska, on May 27, 2011. Within two days of announcement, the tour sold 625,000 tickets. By April 2011, Swift had added another 16 shows to the North American leg. After the final US concert in New York City on November 22, 2011, the Speak Now World Tour had covered 80 sold-out North American shows. On August 10, 2011, Swift released a music video for \"Sparks Fly\" that includes footage from the tour. She released the album Speak Now World Tour – Live on November 21, 2011. In December 2011, Swift announced an extension of the tour to Australia and New Zealand starting in March 2012. Concluding on March 18, 2012, the Speak Now World Tour had covered 110 shows, visited 18 countries, and grossed $123.7 million..",
    "Before Speak Now's release, Big Machine shipped two million copies of the album to stores in the US. In the week ending November 13, 2010, the album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 1,047,000 copies. It marked the highest single-week tally for a female country artist and became the first album since Lil Wayne's Tha Carter III  to sell over one million copies in its first week of release. Media publications including Billboard, MTV, and The New York Times noted Speak Now's first-week sales figures in the context of declining record sales brought about by the emergence of music download platforms.",
    "According to The New York Times, although the music industry in 2010 saw album sales \" by more than 50 percent in the last decade\", the album's strong sales proved Swift \"has transcended the limitations of genre and become a pop megastar\". The Guinness World Records in 2010 recognized Speak Now as the fastest-selling album in the US by a female country artist..",
    "In Speak Now's first charting week, 11 of the standard edition's 14 tracks charted on the Billboard Hot 100, making Swift the first female artist to have 11 songs on the Hot 100 at the same time. After the digital release of the deluxe edition tracks in November 2011, \"If This Was a Movie\" charted at number 10 on the Hot 100, making Swift the first artist to have eight songs debut in the top 10. With this achievement, Speak Now had three songs peaking in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100—\"Mine\", \"Back to December\", and \"If This Was a Movie\". The album spent six non-consecutive weeks atop the Billboard 200. Speak Now was the third-best-selling album of 2010 in the US with sales of 2,960,000 copies. By October 2020, it had sold 4,710,000 copies in the US. The RIAA certified the album six-times platinum, denoting six million album-equivalent units based on sales, song downloads, and streaming.."

Kirk Borne, an astrophysicist who was employed as a data scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center at the time, noted in an April 2013 TED talk that he had used the phrase \"unknown unknowns\" in a talk to personnel at the Homeland Security Transition Planning Office a few days prior to Rumsfeld's remarks, and speculated that the term may have percolated up to Rumsfeld and other high-ranking officials in the Defense Department..",
    "The terms \"known unknowns\" and \"unknown unknowns\" are often used in project management and strategic planning circles.",
    "Psychoanalytic philosopher Slavoj Žižek says that beyond these three categories there is a fourth, the unknown known, that which one intentionally refuses to acknowledge that one knows: \"If Rumsfeld thinks that the main dangers in the confrontation with Iraq were the 'unknown unknowns', that is, the threats from Saddam whose nature we cannot even suspect, then the Abu Ghraib scandal shows that the main dangers lie in the \"unknown knowns\"—the disavowed beliefs, suppositions and obscene practices we pretend not to know about, even though they form the background of our public values.\".",
    "Rumsfeld named his 2011 autobiography Known and Unknown: A Memoir.",
    "In the author's note at the start of the book, he expressly acknowledges the source of his memoir's title and mentions a few examples of his statement's prominence. The Unknown Known is the title of Errol Morris's 2013 biographical documentary film about Rumsfeld. In it, Rumsfield initially defines \"unknown knowns\" as \"the things you think you know, that it turns out you did not\", and toward the end of the film he defines the term as \"things that you know, that you don't know you know\"..",

  "dream": [
    "A dream is a succession of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep. Humans spend about two hours dreaming per night, and each dream lasts around 5 to 20 minutes, although the dreamer may perceive the dream as being much longer than this..",
    "The content and function of dreams have been topics of scientific, philosophical and religious interest throughout recorded history.",
    "Dream interpretation, practiced by the Babylonians in the third millennium BCE and even earlier by the ancient Sumerians, figures prominently in religious texts in several traditions, and has played a lead role in psychotherapy. The scientific study of dreams is called oneirology. Most modern dream study focuses on the neurophysiology of dreams and on proposing and testing hypotheses regarding dream function.",
    "It is not known where in the brain dreams originate, if there is a single origin for dreams or if multiple regions of the brain are involved, or what the purpose of dreaming is for the body or mind.",
    "The human dream experience and what to make of it has undergone sizable shifts over the course of history. Long ago, according to writings from Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt, dreams dictated post-dream behaviors to an extent sharply reduced in later millennia.",
    "These ancient writings about dreams highlight visitation dreams, where a dream figure, usually a deity or a prominent forebear, commands the dreamer to take specific actions and may predict future events. Framing the dream experience varies across cultures as well as through time.",
    "Dreaming and sleep are intertwined.",
    "Dreams occur mainly in the rapid-eye movement  stage of sleep—when brain activity is high and resembles that of being awake.",
    "Because REM sleep is detectable in many species, and because research suggests that all mammals experience REM, linking dreams to REM sleep has led to conjectures that animals dream.",
    "However, humans dream during non-REM sleep, also, and not all REM awakenings elicit dream reports. To be studied, a dream must first be reduced to a verbal report, which is an account of the subject's memory of the dream, not the subject's dream experience itself.",
    "So, dreaming by non-humans is currently unprovable, as is dreaming by human fetuses and pre-verbal infants..",
    "Preserved writings from early Mediterranean civilizations indicate a relatively abrupt change in subjective dream experience between Bronze Age antiquity and the beginnings of the classical era..",
    "In visitation dreams reported in ancient writings, dreamers were largely passive in their dreams, and visual content served primarily to frame authoritative auditory messaging. Gudea, the king of the Sumerian city-state of Lagash (reigned c.",
    "2144–2124 BCE), rebuilt the temple of Ningirsu as the result of a dream in which he was told to do so. After antiquity, the passive hearing of visitation dreams largely gave way to visualized narratives in which the dreamer becomes a character who actively participates.",
    "Hall collected more than 50,000 dream reports at Western Reserve University.",
    "In 1966, Hall and Robert Van de Castle published The Content Analysis of Dreams, in which they outlined a coding system to study 1,000 dream reports from college students. Results indicated that participants from varying parts of the world demonstrated similarity in their dream content.",
    "The only residue of antiquity's authoritative dream figure in the Hall and Van de Castle listing of dream characters is the inclusion of God in the category of prominent persons. Hall's complete dream reports were made publicly available in the mid-1990s by his protégé William Domhoff.",
    "More recent studies of dream reports, while providing more detail, continue to cite the Hall study favorably..",
    "In the Hall study, the most common emotion experienced in dreams was anxiety.",
    "Negative emotions were much more common than positive ones. The Hall data analysis showed that sexual dreams occur no more than 10% of the time and are more prevalent in young to mid-teens. Another study showed that 8% of both men's and women's dreams have sexual content. In some cases, sexual dreams may result in orgasms or nocturnal emissions.",
    "These are colloquially known as \"wet dreams\"..",
    "The visual nature of dreams is generally highly phantasmagoric; that is, different locations and objects continuously blend into each other.",
    "Some dreams may even tell elaborate stories wherein the dreamer enters entirely new, complex worlds and awakes with ideas, thoughts and feelings never experienced prior to the dream.",
    "People who are blind from birth do not have visual dreams.",
    "Their dream contents are related to other senses like hearing, touch, smell and taste, whichever are present since birth..",
    "Dream study is popular with scientists exploring the mind–brain problem.",
    "Some \"propose to reduce aspects of dream phenomenology to neurobiology.\" But current science cannot specify dream physiology in detail.",
    "As stated by the Society for Neuroscience, \"Because no adequate alternatives exist, much of this research must  be done on animal subjects.\" However, since animal dreaming can be only inferred, not confirmed, animal studies yield no hard facts to illuminate the neurophysiology of dreams.",
    "Denied precision tools, obliged to depend on imaging, much dream research has succumbed to the law of the instrument.",
    "Studies detect an increase of blood flow in a specific brain region and then credit that region with a role in generating dreams."

However, from the Seleucid Empire , this term was also applied to The Levant, and from this point the Greeks applied the term without distinction between the Assyrians of Mesopotamia and Arameans of the Levant. Mainstream modern academic opinion strongly favors the argument that the Greek word is related to the cognate Ἀσσυρία, Assyria, ultimately derived from the Akkadian Aššur.

    "Eyes are organs of the visual system.",
    "Eyes detect light and convert it into electro-chemical impulses in neurons .",
    "In higher organisms, the eye is a complex optical system which collects light from the surrounding environment, regulates its intensity through a diaphragm, focuses it through an adjustable assembly of lenses to form an image, converts this image into a set of electrical signals, and transmits these signals to the brain through complex neural pathways that connect the eye via the optic nerve to the visual cortex and other areas of the brain.",
    "Eyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms, and 96% of animal species possess a complex optical system. Image-resolving eyes are present in molluscs, chordates and arthropods..",
    "The most simple eyes, pit eyes, are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angle of light that enters and affects the eye-spot, to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light. From more complex eyes, retinal photosensitive ganglion cells send signals along the retinohypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nuclei to effect circadian adjustment and to the pretectal area to control the pupillary light reflex.",
    "Complex eyes distinguish shapes and colours.",
    "In other organisms, particularly prey animals, eyes are located to maximise the field of view, such as in rabbits and horses, which have monocular vision.",
    "The first proto-eyes evolved among animals 600 million years ago about the time of the Cambrian explosion. The last common ancestor of animals possessed the biochemical toolkit necessary for vision, and more advanced eyes have evolved in 96% of animal species in six of the ~35 main phyla. In most vertebrates and some molluscs, the eye allows light to enter and project onto a light-sensitive layer of cells known as the retina.",
    "Such eyes are typically spheroid, filled with the transparent gel-like vitreous humour, possess a focusing lens, and often an iris.",
    "Muscles around the iris change the size of the pupil, regulating the amount of light that enters the eye and reducing aberrations when there is enough light. The eyes of most cephalopods, fish, amphibians and snakes have fixed lens shapes, and focusing is achieved by telescoping the lens in a similar manner to that of a camera..",
    "The compound eyes of the arthropods are composed of many simple facets which, depending on anatomical detail, may give either a single pixelated image or multiple images per eye.",
    "Some eyes have up to 28,000 such sensors arranged hexagonally, which can give a full 360° field of vision.",
    "Compound eyes are very sensitive to motion.",
    "Some arthropods, including many Strepsiptera, have compound eyes of only a few facets, each with a retina capable of creating an image.",
    "With each eye producing a different image, a fused, high-resolution image is produced in the brain.",

Ocelli, some of the simplest eyes, are found in animals such as some of the snails.",
    "In organisms dwelling near deep-sea vents, compound eyes are adapted to see the infra-red light produced by the hot vents; enabling the creatures to avoid being boiled alive..",
    "There are ten different eye layouts—indeed every technological method of capturing an optical image commonly used by human beings, with the exceptions of zoom and Fresnel lenses, occur in nature. Eye types can be categorised into \"simple eyes\", with one concave photoreceptive surface, and \"compound eyes\", which comprise a number of individual lenses laid out on a convex surface. Note that \"simple\" does not imply a reduced level of complexity or acuity.",
    "Indeed, any eye type can be adapted for almost any behaviour or environment.",
    "The only limitations specific to eye types are that of resolution—the physics of compound eyes prevents them from achieving a resolution better than 1°.",
    "Also, superposition eyes can achieve greater sensitivity than apposition eyes, so are better suited to dark-dwelling creatures. Eyes also fall into two groups on the basis of their photoreceptor's cellular construction, with the photoreceptor cells either being cilliated  or rhabdomeric.",
    "These are not considered eyes because they lack enough structure to be considered an organ, and do not produce an image..",
    "Simple eyes are rather ubiquitous, and lens-bearing eyes have evolved at least seven times in vertebrates, cephalopods, annelids, crustaceans and cubozoa..",
    "Pit eyes, also known as stemma, are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angles of light that enters and affects the eye-spot, to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light. Found in about 85% of phyla, these basic forms were probably the precursors to more advanced types of \"simple eyes\"."

Functional analyses of the features unique to the hand of modern humans have shown that they are consistent with the stresses and requirements associated with the effective use of paleolithic stone tools. It is possible that the refinement of the bipedal posture in the earliest hominids evolved to facilitate the use of the trunk as leverage in accelerating the hand..",
    "While the human hand has unique anatomical features, including a longer thumb and fingers that can be controlled individually to a higher degree, the hands of other primates are anatomically similar and the dexterity of the human hand can not be explained solely on anatomical factors.",
    "The neural machinery underlying hand movements is a major contributing factor; primates have evolved direct connections between neurons in cortical motor areas and spinal motoneurons, giving the cerebral cortex monosynaptic control over the motoneurons of the hand muscles; placing the hands \"closer\" to the brain. The recent evolution of the human hand is thus a direct result of the development of the central nervous system, and the hand, therefore, is a direct tool of our consciousness—the main source of differentiated tactile sensations—and a precise working organ enabling gestures—the expressions of our personalities..",
    "The proportions of the human hand are plesiomorphic ; the elongated thumbs and short hands more closely resemble the hand proportions of Miocene apes than those of extant primates. Humans did not evolve from knuckle-walking apes, and chimpanzees and gorillas independently acquired elongated metacarpals as part of their adaptation to their modes of locomotion. Several primitive hand features most likely present in the chimpanzee-human last common ancestor  and absent in modern humans are still present in the hands of Australopithecus, Paranthropus, and Homo floresiensis.",

    "This applies regardless of the usable number of limbs—even arthropods, with six, eight, or more limbs, walk..",
    "The word walk is descended from the Old English wealcan \"to roll\".",
    "In humans and other bipeds, walking is generally distinguished from running in that only one foot at a time leaves contact with the ground and there is a period of double-support.",
    "This distinction has the status of a formal requirement in competitive walking events.",
    "For quadrupedal species, there are numerous gaits which may be termed walking or running, and distinctions based upon the presence or absence of a suspended phase or the number of feet in contact any time do not yield mechanically correct classification. The most effective method to distinguish walking from running is to measure the height of a person's centre of mass using motion capture or a force plate at midstance.",
    "During walking, the centre of mass reaches a maximum height at midstance, while running, it is then at a minimum.",
    "For walking up grades above 10%, this distinction no longer holds for some individuals.",
    "Definitions based on the percentage of the stride during which a foot is in contact with the ground  of greater than 50% contact corresponds well with identification of 'inverted pendulum' mechanics and are indicative of walking for animals with any number of limbs, although this definition is incomplete. Running humans and animals may have contact periods greater than 50% of a gait cycle when rounding corners, running uphill or carrying loads.",
    "Speed is another factor that distinguishes walking from running.",
    "Although walking speeds can vary greatly depending on many factors such as height, weight, age, terrain, surface, load, culture, effort, and fitness, the average human walking speed at crosswalks is about 5.0 kilometres per hour , or about 1.4 meters per second , or about 3.1 miles per hour .",
    "Specific studies have found pedestrian walking speeds at crosswalks ranging from 4.51 to 4.75 km/h  for older individuals and from 5.32 to 5.43 km/h  for younger individuals; a brisk walking speed can be around 6.5 km/h . In Japan, the standard measure for walking speed is 80 m/min .",
    "Champion racewalkers can average more than 14 km/h  over a distance of 20 km .",
    "An average human child achieves independent walking ability at around 11 months old..",
    "Regular, brisk exercise of any kind can improve confidence, stamina, energy, weight control and life expectancy and reduces stress. It can also decrease the risk of coronary heart disease, strokes, diabetes, high blood pressure, bowel cancer and osteoporosis. Scientific studies have also shown that walking, besides its physical benefits, is also beneficial for the mind, improving memory skills, learning ability, concentration, mood, creativity, and abstract reasoning. Sustained walking sessions for a minimum period of thirty to sixty minutes a day, five days a week, with the correct walking posture, reduce health risks and have various overall health benefits, such as reducing the chances of cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, anxiety disorder and depression. Life expectancy is also increased even for individuals suffering from obesity or high blood pressure.",
    "Walking also improves bone health, especially strengthening the hip bone, and lowering the harmful low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol, and raising the useful high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol. Studies have found that walking may also help prevent dementia and Alzheimer's. Walking at a pace that increases ones heart rate to 70% of their maximum heart rate, also known as the \"fat-burning heart rate\" can cause the body to utilize its fat reserves for energy leading to fat loss.

    "The ancient oppidum that corresponds to the modern city of Paris was first mentioned in the mid-1st century BC by Julius Caesar as Luteciam Parisiorum , and is later attested as Parision in the 5th century AD, then as Paris in 1265. During the Roman period, it was commonly known as Lutetia or Lutecia in Latin, and as Leukotekía in Greek, which is interpreted as either stemming from the Celtic root *lukot- , or from *luto- , depending on whether the Latin or Greek form is the closest to the original Gaulish name..",
    "The name Paris is derived from its early inhabitants, the Parisii , a Gallic tribe from the Iron Age and the Roman period. The meaning of the Gaulish ethnonym remains debated.",
    "According to Xavier Delamarre, it may derive from the Celtic root pario- . Alfred Holder interpreted the name as 'the makers' or 'the commanders', by comparing it to the Welsh peryff , both possibly descending from a Proto-Celtic form reconstructed as *kwar-is-io-. Alternatively, Pierre-Yves Lambert proposed to translate Parisii as the 'spear people', by connecting the first element to the Old Irish carr , derived from an earlier *kwar-sā. In any case, the city's name is not related to the Paris of Greek mythology.",

The Parisii traded with many river towns  and minted their own coins for that purpose..",
    "The Romans conquered the Paris Basin in 52 BC and began their settlement on Paris's Left Bank. The Roman town was originally called Lutetia .",
    "By the end of the Western Roman Empire, the town was known as Parisius, a Latin name that would later become Paris in French. Christianity was introduced in the middle of the 3rd century AD by Saint Denis, the first Bishop of Paris: according to legend, when he refused to renounce his faith before the Roman occupiers, he was beheaded on the hill which became known as Mons Martyrum , later \"Montmartre\", from where he walked headless to the north of the city; the place where he fell and was buried became an important religious shrine, the Basilica of Saint-Denis, and many French kings are buried there..",

  "monkey": [
    "Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians.",
    "Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes, which constitutes an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes  are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regards to their scope..",
    "In 1812, Geoffroy grouped the apes and the Cercopithecidae group of monkeys together and established the name Catarrhini, \"Old World monkeys\", . The extant sister of the Catarrhini in the monkey  group is the Platyrrhini . Some nine million years before the divergence between the Cercopithecidae and the apes, the Platyrrhini emerged within \"monkeys\" by migration to South America from Afro-Arabia , likely by ocean. Apes are thus deep in the tree of extant and extinct monkeys, and any of the apes is distinctly closer related to the Cercopithecidae than the Platyrrhini are.",
    "Many monkey species are tree-dwelling , although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons.",
    "Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys.",
    "Within suborder Haplorhini, the simians are a sister group to the tarsiers – the two members diverged some 70 million years ago. New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians roughly 35 million years ago.",
    "Old World monkeys and apes emerged within the catarrhine monkeys about 25 million years ago.",
    "Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus  are also considered monkeys by primatologists..",
    "Lemurs, lorises, and galagos are not monkeys, but strepsirrhine primates .",
    "The simians' sister group, the tarsiers, are also haplorhine primates; however, they are also not monkeys.",
    "Apes emerged within monkeys as sister of the Cercopithecidae in the Catarrhini, so cladistically they are monkeys as well.",
    "However, there has been resistance to directly designate apes  as monkeys, so \"Old World monkey\" may be taken to mean either the Cercopithecoidea  or the Catarrhini . That apes are monkeys was already realized by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in the 18th century. Linnaeus placed this group in 1758 together with the tarsiers, in a single genus \"Simia\" , an ensemble now recognised as the Haplorhini..",
    "Monkeys, including apes, can be distinguished from other primates by having only two pectoral nipples, a pendulous penis, and a lack of sensory whiskers..",
    "According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word \"monkey\" may originate in a German version of the Reynard the Fox fable, published circa 1580.",
    "In this version of the fable, a character named Moneke is the son of Martin the Ape. In English, no clear distinction was originally made between \"ape\" and \"monkey\"; thus the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica entry for \"ape\" notes that it is either a synonym for \"monkey\" or is used to mean a tailless humanlike primate. Colloquially, the terms \"monkey\" and \"ape\" are widely used interchangeably. Also, a few monkey species have the word \"ape\" in their common name, such as the Barbary ape.",
    "Later in the first half of the 20th century, the idea developed that there were trends in primate evolution and that the living members of the order could be arranged in a series, leading through \"monkeys\" and \"apes\" to humans. Monkeys thus constituted a \"grade\" on the path to humans and were distinguished from \"apes\".",
    "The New World monkeys and the Old World monkeys are each monophyletic groups, but their combination was not, since it excluded hominoids .",
    "Thus, the term \"monkey\" no longer referred to a recognized scientific taxon.",
    "The smallest accepted taxon which contains all the monkeys is the infraorder Simiiformes, or simians.",
    "However this also contains the hominoids, so that monkeys are, in terms of currently recognized taxa, non-hominoid simians.",
    "Colloquially and pop-culturally, the term is ambiguous and sometimes monkey includes non-human hominoids. In addition, frequent arguments are made for a monophyletic usage of the word \"monkey\" from the perspective that usage should reflect cladistics..",
    "A group of monkeys may be commonly referred to as a tribe or a troop..",
    "Two separate groups of primates are referred to as \"monkeys\": New World monkeys  from South and Central America and Old World monkeys  from Africa and Asia.",
    "Apes —consisting of gibbons, orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos, and humans—are also catarrhines but were classically distinguished from monkeys. Tailless monkeys may be called \"apes\", incorrectly according to modern usage; thus the tailless Barbary macaque is historically called the \"Barbary ape\".",
    "As apes have emerged in the monkey group as sister of the old world monkeys, characteristics that describe monkeys are generally shared by apes as well.",
    "Monkeys range in size from the pygmy marmoset, which can be as small as 117 mm  with a 172 mm  tail and just over 100 g  in weight, to the male mandrill, almost 1 m  long and weighing up to 36 kg . Some are arboreal  while others live on the savanna; diets differ among the various species but may contain any of the following: fruit, leaves, seeds, nuts, flowers, eggs and small animals ..",
    "Some characteristics are shared among the groups; most New World monkeys have long tails, with those in the Atelidae family being prehensile, while Old World monkeys have non-prehensile tails or no visible tail at all.",
    "Old World monkeys have trichromatic color vision like that of humans, while New World monkeys may be trichromatic, dichromatic, or—as in the owl monkeys and greater galagos—monochromatic.",
    "Although both the New and Old World monkeys, like the apes, have forward-facing eyes, the faces of Old World and New World monkeys look very different, though again, each group shares some features such as the types of noses, cheeks and rumps..",

    "George Best  was a Northern Irish professional footballer who played as a winger, spending most of his club career at Manchester United.",
    "A highly skilful dribbler, Best is regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport. He was named European Footballer of the Year in 1968 and came fifth in the FIFA Player of the Century vote.",
    "Best received plaudits for his playing style, which combined pace, skill, balance, feints, two-footedness, goalscoring and the ability to get past defenders.",
    "Born in Belfast, Best began his club career in England with Manchester United, with the scout who had spotted his talent at the age of 15 sending a telegram to manager Matt Busby which read: \"I think I've found you a genius\".",
    "In international football, Best was capped 37 times for Northern Ireland between 1964 and 1977.",
    "With his good looks, dark Beatle mop-top hair and playboy lifestyle, Best became one of the first media celebrity footballers, earning the nickname \"o Beatle\" by Portuguese press reporters after a stand-out performance for Manchester United in Lisbon in March 1966.",
    "George Best was the first child of Richard \"Dickie\" Best  and Anne Withers .",
    "Best was brought up in the Free Presbyterian faith. His father was a member of the Orange Order and as a boy George carried the strings of the banner in his local Cregagh lodge.",

    "Best's mother Anne died from alcoholism-related cardiovascular disease in 1978, at the age of 55. Best's father died on 16 April 2008, at the age of 88, in the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald, Northern Ireland..",
    "In 1957, the academically gifted Best passed the 11-plus and went to Grosvenor High School, but he soon played truant as the school specialised in rugby union.",
    "Best then moved to Lisnasharragh Secondary School, reuniting him with friends from primary school and allowing him to focus on football.",
    "At the age of 15 Best was discovered in Belfast by Manchester United scout Bob Bishop, whose telegram to United manager Matt Busby read: \"I think I've found you a genius.\" His local club Glentoran had previously rejected him for being \"too small and light\". Best was subsequently given a trial and signed up by United's chief scout Joe Armstrong.",
    "His first time moving to the club, Best quickly became homesick and stayed for only two days before going back home to Northern Ireland. He returned to Manchester and spent two years as an amateur, as English clubs were not allowed to take Northern Irish players on as apprentices.",
    "Best made his First Division debut, aged 17, on 14 September 1963 against West Bromwich Albion at Old Trafford in a 1–0 victory. He then dropped back into the reserves, before scoring his first goal for the first team in his second appearance in a 5–1 win over Burnley on 28 December. Manager Matt Busby then kept Best in the team, and by the end of the 1963–64 season, he had made 26 appearances, scoring six goals.",
    "They also reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where a defeat to West Ham United cost Best the chance to break a record; in the final Preston North End's Howard Kendall became the youngest ever player in a FA Cup Final – he shared the same birth date as Best. That same season, Best captained the Manchester United side that won the 1964 FA Youth Cup, the sixth FA Youth Cup won under the management of Jimmy Murphy, and the first since the 1958 Munich air disaster..",
    "Though opponents would often use rough play to try to stifle his technical ability, Busby ensured that \"fierce, sometimes brutal\" training sessions left Best well used to coping with tough challenges. In the 1964–65 season, his first full season as a first team regular, Best helped Manchester United to claim the league title. A 1–0 victory at Elland Road proved decisive as the title race came down to goal average between the \"Red Devils\" and bitter rivals Leeds United; Leeds did manage to gain some measure of revenge though by knocking Manchester United out of the FA Cup at the semi-final stage. Over the course of the campaign Best contributed 14 goals in 59 competitive games. He scored the opening goal of the 1965 FA Charity Shield at Old Trafford, which ended in a 2–2 draw with Liverpool..",
    "The rising star of English football, Best was catapulted to superstar status at the age of 19 when he scored two goals in a European Cup quarter-final match against Benfica at the Estádio da Luz on 9 March 1966. His stand-out display allied with his dark Beatle mop-top hair, the Portuguese media dubbed him \"O Quinto Beatle\" , and on the team's return to England, Best was photographed on the airport tarmac in his new sombrero with the headline, \"El Beatle\". His talent and showmanship made him a crowd and media favourite, and he went from being headline news in the back pages to the front pages..",
    "Other nicknames included the \"Belfast Boy\", and he was often referred to as Georgie, or Geordie in his native Belfast. However United failed to win any major honours in the 1965–66 season, and Best was injured from 26 March onwards with a twisted knee following a bad tackle from a Preston North End player. However United staff claimed it was light ligament damage so as to keep Best on the field for the rest of the campaign. He had little faith in the United medical staff, and so he secretly saw Glentoran's physiotherapist, who readjusted his ligaments in a painful procedure. His last game of the season, his knee strapped-up, came on 13 April, and ended in a 2–0 defeat to Partizan Belgrade at Partizan Stadium..",
    "Best stated that \"if the championship was decided on home games we would win it every season.",
